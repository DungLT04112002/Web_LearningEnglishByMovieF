1
00:01:35,429 --> 00:01:36,430
Oh.

2
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:54,907
Ah!

3
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:57,868
<i>Please keep
all limbs and branches inside.</i>

4
00:02:07,211 --> 00:02:09,087
Oh. I believe this is yours.

5
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,255
Oh, thanks.

6
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,709
<i>Welcome to Element City.</i>

7
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:32,444
<i>Please have your documents
ready for inspection.</i>

8
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:40,702
Next.

9
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:43,288
Your names?

10
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:49,336
Great.
And how do we spell that?

11
00:02:54,508 --> 00:02:58,053
How about we just go
with Bernie and Cinder?

12
00:03:00,931 --> 00:03:02,558
Welcome to Element City.

13
00:03:08,272 --> 00:03:10,774
Hot logs.
Hot logs for sale.

14
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:20,909
Yay!

15
00:03:24,872 --> 00:03:26,456
Cantankerous guy...

16
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,458
Hey, watch it, Sparky!

17
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:49,188
Water.

18
00:04:00,157 --> 00:04:01,408
Dry leaves.

19
00:04:06,955 --> 00:04:07,956
Hmm.

20
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,732
I'm okay.

21
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,244
Aw.

22
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,874
Mm.

23
00:04:50,958 --> 00:04:55,212
Welcome, my Ember,
to your new life.

24
00:05:02,261 --> 00:05:05,180
Our Blue Flame hold
all our traditions

25
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,975
and give us strength
to burn bright.

26
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,857
Do I burn as bright?

27
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:21,905
One, two, one, two, one, two.

28
00:05:22,781 --> 00:05:24,658
- Aah!
- Aah!

29
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:25,742
Aah!

30
00:05:34,418 --> 00:05:37,254
This shop is dream
of our family.

31
00:05:37,588 --> 00:05:39,882
Someday it'll all be yours.

32
00:05:44,136 --> 00:05:45,137
- Welcome.
- Welcome.

33
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:46,346
Everything here authentic.

34
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:48,015
Then I've got
to try the kol-nuts.

35
00:05:48,098 --> 00:05:49,391
Kol-nuts, coming up.

36
00:05:49,474 --> 00:05:50,767
Kol-nut, coming up.

37
00:05:51,935 --> 00:05:53,020
Good daughter.

38
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,984
Someday this shop
will all be mine.

39
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,820
When you are ready.

40
00:06:10,162 --> 00:06:11,246
Delivery!

41
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,123
Two sugar pops, please.

42
00:06:13,415 --> 00:06:14,708
I got it, <i>Àshfá.</i>

43
00:06:25,427 --> 00:06:26,803
Hey!

44
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:30,265
Oh!

45
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:32,643
Water. Keep an eye on them.

46
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:35,437
- Oops.
- Oops.

47
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,439
You splash it, you buy it.

48
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,945
You showed them, huh?

49
00:06:43,028 --> 00:06:44,738
Nobody waters down Fire.

50
00:06:44,821 --> 00:06:46,573
Yeah!

51
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,743
Can the shop be mine now?

52
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,286
When you are ready.

53
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,664
{\an8}<i>-The truth is...</i>
- She's not in love with him.

54
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,499
<i>I'm not in love with you.</i>

55
00:06:55,582 --> 00:06:57,751
Ha! Knew it.

56
00:07:05,008 --> 00:07:06,343
<i>Àshfá,</i> customer.

57
00:07:07,052 --> 00:07:09,137
How about you take it today?

58
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,681
For real?

59
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:21,733
- How can I help you?
- All of this and the...

60
00:07:21,817 --> 00:07:23,503
Oh! The sparklers are
buy one, get one free?

61
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:24,653
- That's right.
- Great!

62
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:25,946
I'll just take the free one.

63
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:27,614
Oh, no, see...

64
00:07:27,698 --> 00:07:30,158
you need to buy one
to get one free.

65
00:07:30,242 --> 00:07:32,369
{\an8}But I just want the free one.

66
00:07:32,661 --> 00:07:35,581
Sorry, that's not
how this works.

67
00:07:35,664 --> 00:07:37,082
{\an8}But the customer
is always right.

68
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,792
Not in this case.

69
00:07:40,252 --> 00:07:42,212
Nope.

70
00:07:42,296 --> 00:07:44,798
Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.
Nope. Nope. Nope.

71
00:07:44,882 --> 00:07:46,258
Just give me one for free!

72
00:07:46,341 --> 00:07:47,801
That's not how this works!

73
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,723
Oh!

74
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,266
Happy birthday.

75
00:07:54,349 --> 00:07:56,435
What just happened?
Why you lose temper?

76
00:07:56,518 --> 00:07:59,479
I don't know. He was pushing,
and pushing, and it just...

77
00:07:59,563 --> 00:08:01,064
Calm, calm.

78
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,275
Sometimes customer can be tough.

79
00:08:03,358 --> 00:08:05,235
Just take breath...

80
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,821
and make connection.

81
00:08:08,739 --> 00:08:11,241
When you can do that
and not lose temper,

82
00:08:11,325 --> 00:08:14,119
then you will be ready
to take over shop.

83
00:08:16,496 --> 00:08:17,873
This is too expensive,

84
00:08:17,956 --> 00:08:19,276
and that is not made
in Fire Land.

85
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,518
- They weren't crunchy and...
- Take breath.

86
00:08:20,542 --> 00:08:21,853
- There wasn't enough sauce.
- Make connection.

87
00:08:21,877 --> 00:08:24,838
Take breath.
Make connection.

88
00:08:24,922 --> 00:08:26,882
Take breath. Make connection.

89
00:08:26,965 --> 00:08:29,176
Take breath. Make connection!

90
00:08:32,387 --> 00:08:34,181
Sorry.

91
00:08:34,264 --> 00:08:35,807
Sorry about that.
Sorry, sorry.

92
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:38,435
She almost went full purple.

93
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:40,812
I've never seen anyone
go full purple.

94
00:08:40,896 --> 00:08:42,147
Sorry, everyone.

95
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,899
Oh, please forgive my daughter.

96
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:47,402
She burn bright,
but sometimes too bright. Eh?

97
00:08:47,903 --> 00:08:49,780
Nice hat, by the way.

98
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:52,491
Let me make you a new batch.
On the house.

99
00:08:52,574 --> 00:08:54,409
Okay.

100
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:55,494
Sorry, <i>Àshfá.</i>

101
00:08:55,661 --> 00:08:57,412
I don't know why that one
got away from me.

102
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,789
Oh, you are tense

103
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:01,041
because of big
Red Dot Sale tomorrow.

104
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:03,168
It has us all in a broil.

105
00:09:03,252 --> 00:09:04,628
I guess.

106
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,421
It's just that some
of these customers,

107
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:07,881
they get me all...

108
00:09:07,965 --> 00:09:10,676
I know. I know.
Just do what we practice.

109
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:12,594
{\an8}You are so good
at everything else.

110
00:09:12,845 --> 00:09:14,555
You're right. I'll get it.

111
00:09:14,638 --> 00:09:16,181
I just want you to rest.

112
00:09:19,017 --> 00:09:20,269
Mm-hmm.

113
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,146
Done.

114
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:28,235
{\an8}You okay?

115
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:29,862
{\an8}Just tired.

116
00:09:29,945 --> 00:09:31,029
{\an8}Let me help.

117
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,076
Bernie, that cough is terrible!

118
00:09:36,159 --> 00:09:38,787
Almost as terrible
as your cooking!

119
00:09:38,871 --> 00:09:40,747
Ê shútsh...

120
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:41,999
When you gonna put Ember

121
00:09:42,082 --> 00:09:43,792
out of her misery
and retire, huh?

122
00:09:43,876 --> 00:09:46,211
Finally put her name
on the sign out there?

123
00:09:46,295 --> 00:09:48,839
Ah. She take over
when she's ready.

124
00:09:49,339 --> 00:09:50,924
And speaking of ready,

125
00:09:51,008 --> 00:09:53,760
we are more than ready for you
to actually buy something

126
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:55,679
if you'd ever get up
off your lazy ash.

127
00:09:55,762 --> 00:09:57,764
Oh, burn!

128
00:09:59,349 --> 00:10:01,643
But she is so close.

129
00:10:01,727 --> 00:10:05,355
I mean, she'll probably never
do deliveries as quick as me.

130
00:10:05,439 --> 00:10:07,274
You don't think
that I can beat your record?

131
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:09,026
Because I have been
taking it easy on you,

132
00:10:09,109 --> 00:10:10,170
so I don't hurt...

133
00:10:10,194 --> 00:10:11,612
your feelings,
Mr. Smokestack.

134
00:10:11,695 --> 00:10:13,780
But game on.

135
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:19,703
{\an8}Before I see if you are a match,

136
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:21,914
I splash this on your heart

137
00:10:21,997 --> 00:10:24,082
to bring love to the surface.

138
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:27,336
And I will read the smoke.

139
00:10:33,217 --> 00:10:34,927
Ember, I'm doing a reading.

140
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:37,346
Sorry, got to grab some stuff.
Going for Dad's record.

141
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,264
So, are we a match?

142
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,099
It's true love.

143
00:10:42,309 --> 00:10:44,686
Which is more than I ever
smelled on this one.

144
00:10:44,770 --> 00:10:46,522
Oh, goody, this old chestnut.

145
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,608
Yep. Nothing.

146
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:53,862
Just a loveless,
sad future of sadness.

147
00:10:53,946 --> 00:10:55,739
Ember, work with me.

148
00:10:55,822 --> 00:10:58,909
Your finding match
was my mother's dying wish.

149
00:10:59,451 --> 00:11:01,828
Promise me one thing,

150
00:11:01,912 --> 00:11:04,039
marry Fire.

151
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,085
Nice try, Mom. Got to go.

152
00:11:09,378 --> 00:11:11,088
- Save it for the wedding.
- Hey.

153
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:14,007
Yo, yo, yo, Ember.

154
00:11:14,091 --> 00:11:15,592
Yo, Clod.
Can't talk, in a hurry.

155
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,553
And don't let my dad
catch you out here again.

156
00:11:17,636 --> 00:11:20,764
What? Come on, he doesn't
like my landscaping?

157
00:11:20,848 --> 00:11:22,933
Anyway, June Bloom is coming

158
00:11:23,016 --> 00:11:26,895
and you just got to be my date
'cause check it out.

159
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,022
I'm all grown up.

160
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:32,276
And I smell good.

161
00:11:32,609 --> 00:11:34,820
Ow. My queen.

162
00:11:36,947 --> 00:11:39,491
Sorry, buddy,
elements don't mix.

163
00:11:40,784 --> 00:11:41,869
Flame. Gotta go.

164
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:44,037
Come on, go to the festival
with me.

165
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:45,831
You never leave
this part of town.

166
00:11:45,914 --> 00:11:47,833
That's because everything
I need is right here.

167
00:11:53,672 --> 00:11:56,425
Plus, the city isn't made
with Fire people in mind.

168
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,760
Sorry, but it'd take
an act of God

169
00:11:58,844 --> 00:12:00,095
to get me across that bridge.

170
00:12:00,179 --> 00:12:01,346
An act of God?

171
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,807
Or an act of Clod?

172
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:07,436
Gotta run.

173
00:12:13,817 --> 00:12:15,194
Ah.

174
00:12:15,277 --> 00:12:16,612
Oh.

175
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:24,828
- As ordered.
- Ooh.

176
00:12:25,621 --> 00:12:26,622
Aw...

177
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,126
Gotta run.
Going for Dad's record.

178
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,005
Move it!

179
00:12:52,022 --> 00:12:53,398
Ha-ha!

180
00:12:53,482 --> 00:12:55,567
Winner winner,
charcoal dinner...

181
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:22,678
Head to bed,
I'll close things up.

182
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:25,764
Still have much to prepare
for Red Dot Sale.

183
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:28,433
Dad, I'll take care of it.
You need to rest.

184
00:13:30,727 --> 00:13:32,145
How?

185
00:13:32,229 --> 00:13:33,480
I learned from the best.

186
00:13:36,358 --> 00:13:39,486
I am old.
I can't do this forever.

187
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:42,030
Now that you've beaten my time,

188
00:13:42,114 --> 00:13:44,241
there's only one thing
you haven't done.

189
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:46,159
Tomorrow I sleep in

190
00:13:46,243 --> 00:13:49,538
and I want you to run shop
for Red Dot Sale.

191
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,456
Seriously? By myself?

192
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:54,334
If you can do that
without losing your temper,

193
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:56,879
it will show me
you are able to take over.

194
00:13:57,713 --> 00:13:58,881
You got it, <i>Àshfá.</i>

195
00:14:02,426 --> 00:14:04,803
I won't let you down, I swear.
You'll see.

196
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:05,888
Mm.

197
00:14:06,597 --> 00:14:07,723
Good daughter.

198
00:14:11,351 --> 00:14:13,145
Yes!

199
00:14:14,146 --> 00:14:17,524
Blue Flame, please,
let this go my way.

200
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:28,994
- Good morning!
- Morning!

201
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:35,876
Take a breath.

202
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:41,048
Calm as a candle.

203
00:14:44,510 --> 00:14:46,929
Morning, welcome
to The Fireplace.

204
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:50,641
Whew!

205
00:14:51,141 --> 00:14:52,768
Whoa, whoa.

206
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:54,937
They're all the same.
Just take one from the top.

207
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:56,220
Thanks for shopping.

208
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,732
So many stickers for sale.

209
00:14:59,983 --> 00:15:01,360
- Are these fragile?
- No, wait.

210
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,393
You have to pay before you eat.

211
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,741
Uh, what's your return policy?

212
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,451
Does this come in a large?

213
00:15:10,994 --> 00:15:11,995
Take breath.

214
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:13,080
My dad broke this.

215
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,206
Make connection.

216
00:15:14,289 --> 00:15:16,017
Mind if I test this kettle?

217
00:15:18,877 --> 00:15:20,170
Be back in five minutes.

218
00:15:35,853 --> 00:15:37,271
Huh?

219
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,355
Huh?

220
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,918
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

221
00:16:01,086 --> 00:16:03,547
Stupid temper. Not today.

222
00:16:06,592 --> 00:16:08,135
What is wrong with me?

223
00:16:20,522 --> 00:16:21,648
What the...?

224
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,152
What a happy family.

225
00:16:25,235 --> 00:16:27,154
Is that you and your dad?

226
00:16:27,613 --> 00:16:29,615
I love dads.

227
00:16:29,990 --> 00:16:33,202
And it's your birthday.

228
00:16:33,702 --> 00:16:35,621
Who are you?
What are you doing here?

229
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:36,705
I don't know.

230
00:16:36,788 --> 00:16:38,582
I was searching for a leak
on the other side

231
00:16:38,665 --> 00:16:40,709
of the river and got sucked in.

232
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,003
This is bad,
I can't lose another job.

233
00:16:43,587 --> 00:16:46,381
I just can't seem
to find my flow.

234
00:16:48,008 --> 00:16:49,009
Dang!

235
00:16:49,092 --> 00:16:51,261
That pipe squished me
all out of shape.

236
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:53,639
That's better.

237
00:16:53,722 --> 00:16:55,098
Dude, just get out of here.

238
00:16:55,182 --> 00:16:57,392
I gotta clean this mess
before my dad sees what I did.

239
00:16:58,143 --> 00:16:59,144
Ooh...

240
00:16:59,603 --> 00:17:00,646
Actually...

241
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,212
I'm afraid I'm gonna
have to write you a ticket.

242
00:17:07,236 --> 00:17:08,570
- A ticket?
- Yeah.

243
00:17:08,654 --> 00:17:10,113
I'm a city inspector,

244
00:17:10,197 --> 00:17:12,157
and this pipe is definitely
not up to code.

245
00:17:12,241 --> 00:17:15,244
I sucked a city inspector
into our pipes?

246
00:17:15,327 --> 00:17:17,162
I know. Ironic, right?

247
00:17:17,246 --> 00:17:18,372
Stop messing with that.

248
00:17:18,455 --> 00:17:19,849
Well, I need
to make sure it's solid.

249
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,874
Everything's solid.

250
00:17:20,958 --> 00:17:21,959
I should know.

251
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,752
My dad rebuilt
this place himself.

252
00:17:24,336 --> 00:17:26,630
Wait, your dad did?

253
00:17:26,713 --> 00:17:30,050
Yes, with his bare hands,
every brick and board.

254
00:17:30,133 --> 00:17:31,844
It was a ruin when he found it.

255
00:17:31,927 --> 00:17:35,138
Wow. He did all
of this himself?

256
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,348
Without permits?

257
00:17:36,431 --> 00:17:37,850
Uh...

258
00:17:37,933 --> 00:17:39,726
I'm gonna have
to write that up too.

259
00:17:39,810 --> 00:17:41,311
First, I'm sucked into a pipe

260
00:17:41,395 --> 00:17:42,688
and now I have
to write citations

261
00:17:42,771 --> 00:17:44,439
that could get this place
shut down.

262
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:46,692
Oh, gosh. It's just too much.

263
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,569
Shut us down?

264
00:17:48,652 --> 00:17:50,529
I know, it's awful.

265
00:17:50,612 --> 00:17:52,322
No, you can't
shut us down, please.

266
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,950
This is a big day for me.
It's our Red Dot Sale.

267
00:17:55,033 --> 00:17:56,577
Hey, take it easy.

268
00:17:56,660 --> 00:17:58,203
This is as hard on me
as it is on you.

269
00:17:58,287 --> 00:17:59,621
- Get back here.
- Sorry.

270
00:17:59,705 --> 00:18:00,945
I got to get these to City Hall

271
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:02,332
before the end of my shift.

272
00:18:06,211 --> 00:18:07,212
Flame.

273
00:18:11,341 --> 00:18:12,509
Get back here.

274
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,344
Hmm?

275
00:18:19,183 --> 00:18:20,392
Huh?

276
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,352
<i>Next stop, Element City.</i>

277
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,959
Whoa!

278
00:18:46,043 --> 00:18:47,044
Hey!

279
00:18:47,127 --> 00:18:48,170
Sorry.

280
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:08,482
Hey!

281
00:19:10,609 --> 00:19:11,818
Huh?

282
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,989
What the...?

283
00:19:21,119 --> 00:19:22,538
<i>This stop, City Hall.</i>

284
00:19:22,621 --> 00:19:23,830
Uh...

285
00:19:23,914 --> 00:19:25,123
Hands off!

286
00:19:25,874 --> 00:19:27,334
- Ooh.
- Hey!

287
00:19:27,417 --> 00:19:28,544
Sorry.

288
00:19:33,257 --> 00:19:34,383
Ugh.

289
00:19:35,551 --> 00:19:36,760
Stop!

290
00:19:39,721 --> 00:19:41,056
Hey!

291
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:42,224
Hey!

292
00:19:45,435 --> 00:19:46,854
Stop.

293
00:19:47,271 --> 00:19:49,398
My new jacket.

294
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:51,859
Whoa!

295
00:20:24,474 --> 00:20:26,226
Hey!

296
00:20:30,272 --> 00:20:32,065
Huh? My chili oil!

297
00:20:34,067 --> 00:20:35,444
Come on, guy.

298
00:20:35,527 --> 00:20:36,987
You can't get through this.

299
00:20:37,821 --> 00:20:40,490
So, it is time
to hand them over.

300
00:20:40,574 --> 00:20:42,034
Oh, boy, I'm sorry.

301
00:20:42,117 --> 00:20:44,411
This is gonna be
really disappointing for you.

302
00:20:44,494 --> 00:20:45,954
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

303
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,623
No, no, no, no, no, no.

304
00:20:47,706 --> 00:20:48,957
Sorry.

305
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:50,375
Please...

306
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:51,960
No.

307
00:20:53,086 --> 00:20:54,922
You don't understand.

308
00:20:57,883 --> 00:20:58,884
Whoa.

309
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,595
This shop is my dad's dream.

310
00:21:02,513 --> 00:21:04,765
If I'm the reason
it gets shut down,

311
00:21:04,848 --> 00:21:05,933
it will kill him.

312
00:21:06,266 --> 00:21:07,267
Oh.

313
00:21:07,351 --> 00:21:09,645
He will never trust me
to take over.

314
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,898
Why didn't you say that before?

315
00:21:14,399 --> 00:21:16,279
Wait, does that mean
you'll tear up the tickets?

316
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:19,029
I mean, I would,
but I just sent them over

317
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:20,272
to the processing department.

318
00:21:21,281 --> 00:21:23,321
But I can take you there
so you can plead your case.

319
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,512
Whoa!

320
00:21:46,181 --> 00:21:48,517
Hey, Fern.

321
00:21:48,767 --> 00:21:49,768
How you doing?

322
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,812
Living the dream.

323
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,732
You know those citations
I just gave you from Firetown?

324
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,361
I was about to send them
to Mrs. Cumulus.

325
00:21:59,444 --> 00:22:01,947
Then get sprayed for fungus rot.

326
00:22:02,030 --> 00:22:03,282
Wait.

327
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,909
Tell him what you told me

328
00:22:05,993 --> 00:22:07,411
about your dad
and letting him down.

329
00:22:07,494 --> 00:22:08,620
No. That's personal.

330
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:09,746
It really got to me.

331
00:22:09,830 --> 00:22:11,331
He might feel it too.

332
00:22:11,415 --> 00:22:12,791
- Her dad will be sup...
- Nope.

333
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:13,876
- Sup...
- Nope.

334
00:22:13,959 --> 00:22:16,295
Super disappointed in her.

335
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:18,172
- Stop it.
- He might even be...

336
00:22:18,255 --> 00:22:20,966
- ashamed.
- What are you doing?

337
00:22:21,049 --> 00:22:22,301
But the main thing is,

338
00:22:22,384 --> 00:22:24,154
if her father can't retire...

339
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:26,346
it will be all Ember's f...

340
00:22:26,430 --> 00:22:27,723
Stop talking!

341
00:22:40,152 --> 00:22:42,905
Looks like I'm going home
early today.

342
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:43,989
No, don't.

343
00:22:45,574 --> 00:22:48,702
Expect to get shut down
within a week.

344
00:22:48,785 --> 00:22:49,786
Have a good one.

345
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:54,166
Sorry.

346
00:23:00,339 --> 00:23:01,548
What?

347
00:23:02,257 --> 00:23:04,092
Already?

348
00:23:04,801 --> 00:23:05,802
Hello?

349
00:23:17,147 --> 00:23:19,566
Oh, no. Dad, what happened?

350
00:23:19,650 --> 00:23:22,945
We lucky nobody hurt.
It ruined Red Dot Sale.

351
00:23:23,028 --> 00:23:24,738
- Did he do this?
- Who?

352
00:23:24,821 --> 00:23:26,490
The Water guy I see you chase.

353
00:23:27,658 --> 00:23:29,326
Oh, uh... Um...

354
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:31,203
Yeah, he did. Uh...

355
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:33,030
He just broke through a pipe.

356
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,581
I don't know why.

357
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,500
Luckily, I was able
to close it off.

358
00:23:36,583 --> 00:23:38,293
I, uh, couldn't
catch him though.

359
00:23:38,377 --> 00:23:40,963
Water, always trying
to water us down.

360
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:44,049
He was a Water person, Dad,
not just water.

361
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:46,593
Ah, same thing.
And why is water in pipes?

362
00:23:46,677 --> 00:23:50,597
City shut down years ago.
There should be no water.

363
00:23:50,681 --> 00:23:52,224
Dad!

364
00:23:54,101 --> 00:23:55,102
Bernie.

365
00:23:55,561 --> 00:23:56,770
We will get through this.

366
00:23:56,854 --> 00:23:58,146
Just like before.

367
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,565
Before?

368
00:23:59,982 --> 00:24:02,359
There is a reason
we left Fire Land.

369
00:24:02,818 --> 00:24:06,280
Oh, Ember,
we loved it there so much.

370
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:09,491
Most everyone had a Blue Flame.

371
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:11,910
And it connected us
all together.

372
00:24:12,286 --> 00:24:14,872
To our traditions. Our family.

373
00:24:15,205 --> 00:24:17,124
<i>It was hard living.</i>

374
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:20,169
<i>But your father began
to build a life for us.</i>

375
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,004
<i>We put everything into it.</i>

376
00:24:22,421 --> 00:24:24,423
<i>But then a great storm came.</i>

377
00:24:35,142 --> 00:24:37,895
<i>All was lost for us.</i>

378
00:24:38,812 --> 00:24:43,901
<i>Your father understood
we had to leave everything.</i>

379
00:24:43,984 --> 00:24:48,238
<i>Our home. It was the only way
to create a better life.</i>

380
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:58,707
<i>It was the last time</i>

381
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:00,876
<i>your father ever saw his family.</i>

382
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:05,339
That is why we came here.

383
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:07,508
To build all this.

384
00:25:13,931 --> 00:25:16,433
<i>Àshfá,</i> nothing will happen
to this shop

385
00:25:16,517 --> 00:25:18,852
or the flame again, I promise.

386
00:25:20,062 --> 00:25:22,481
Mm. Good daughter.

387
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,745
Fire! Fire!

388
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:38,413
- Ah! Fire!
- Hey, hey!

389
00:25:38,497 --> 00:25:39,498
Oh, sorry.

390
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,792
You're so hot.

391
00:25:42,084 --> 00:25:43,085
Excuse me?

392
00:25:44,127 --> 00:25:46,255
No, I mean, like,
you're smoking.

393
00:25:46,338 --> 00:25:47,578
No, I didn't mean it like that.

394
00:25:47,631 --> 00:25:49,424
- Are you done yet?
- Yes, please.

395
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:51,009
I'm waiting to talk
to your boss.

396
00:25:51,093 --> 00:25:54,137
So, make like a stream
and flow somewhere else.

397
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:55,973
Actually,
Gale won't be in today.

398
00:25:56,056 --> 00:25:57,891
She's a huge airball fan

399
00:25:57,975 --> 00:26:00,394
and the Windbreakers
are finally in the playoffs.

400
00:26:00,477 --> 00:26:02,563
Toot toot.

401
00:26:02,646 --> 00:26:04,606
Okay. Well, I just came by

402
00:26:04,690 --> 00:26:07,192
because I left my passes
for the game here last night.

403
00:26:07,651 --> 00:26:09,862
Passes? Like, plural?

404
00:26:40,976 --> 00:26:41,977
Where is she?

405
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,478
Up there, in that skybox.

406
00:26:43,562 --> 00:26:45,606
Come on!

407
00:26:45,689 --> 00:26:46,690
Oh.

408
00:26:46,773 --> 00:26:49,568
Okay. Time to cancel
some tickets.

409
00:26:50,736 --> 00:26:52,321
Toot Toot juice.

410
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:54,781
Get your Toot Toot juice.

411
00:26:55,532 --> 00:26:56,783
Toot Toot juice,

412
00:26:56,867 --> 00:26:59,036
get your Toot Toot juice.

413
00:27:00,537 --> 00:27:02,122
You'll be great. This way.

414
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:03,646
- Excuse me.
- Jimmy, what's up?

415
00:27:03,707 --> 00:27:05,584
- Sorry. Pardon.
- Wendy.

416
00:27:05,667 --> 00:27:07,920
Oh. Sorry.
Fire girl coming through.

417
00:27:08,003 --> 00:27:10,881
Break some wind!

418
00:27:10,964 --> 00:27:12,382
Hi, Gale, how you doing?

419
00:27:12,466 --> 00:27:14,259
Look at the score,
what do you think?

420
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:16,762
Blow the ball, not the game!

421
00:27:17,304 --> 00:27:21,183
Yeah, so, uh, Gale.

422
00:27:21,266 --> 00:27:22,809
My name is Ember Lumen.

423
00:27:22,893 --> 00:27:24,853
My family runs a Fire shop.

424
00:27:24,937 --> 00:27:26,813
Wade wrote us a bunch
of tickets yesterday...

425
00:27:26,897 --> 00:27:28,625
What kind of call was that?

426
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,860
Oh, Lumen? Yeah,
a Fire shop with 30 citations.

427
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,612
Thirty?

428
00:27:33,695 --> 00:27:36,240
Anyway, friend, I was hoping

429
00:27:36,323 --> 00:27:37,800
we could work something out.

430
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,994
Come on, ref! Are your eyes
in the back of your head?

431
00:27:43,664 --> 00:27:45,541
- Oh, no.
- Yeah, bummer.

432
00:27:45,624 --> 00:27:49,044
Oh, yeah.
Okay, so, the 30 citations.

433
00:27:49,127 --> 00:27:50,379
Do you mind?

434
00:27:50,462 --> 00:27:52,840
There's a game going on.
Fireball.

435
00:27:53,298 --> 00:27:54,383
Fireball?

436
00:27:55,384 --> 00:27:56,844
Actually, I do mind.

437
00:27:56,927 --> 00:27:58,887
This is my life
we're talking about.

438
00:27:58,971 --> 00:28:00,097
Not just some game.

439
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:02,891
Some game?
This is the playoffs.

440
00:28:02,975 --> 00:28:05,727
So, forgive me if I don't want
to hear a sob story

441
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,397
about the problems
of some little shop.

442
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,567
Well, that little shop matters
way more

443
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:13,443
than a bunch
of overpaid cloud puffs

444
00:28:13,527 --> 00:28:14,820
blowing some ball around.

445
00:28:14,903 --> 00:28:16,405
I dare you,

446
00:28:16,488 --> 00:28:19,908
say "cloud puffs" one more time.

447
00:28:20,617 --> 00:28:22,870
Cloud puffs.

448
00:28:24,746 --> 00:28:26,057
Oh, no!

449
00:28:26,081 --> 00:28:27,082
Lutz!

450
00:28:38,010 --> 00:28:39,011
Lutz, man.

451
00:28:39,094 --> 00:28:41,680
He's been in such a funk
'cause his mom has been sick.

452
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:48,770
That is so not cool,
he's doing his best.

453
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:51,940
We love you, Lutz!

454
00:28:52,649 --> 00:28:54,818
Lutz!

455
00:28:55,444 --> 00:28:58,322
We love you, Lutz!

456
00:28:58,405 --> 00:29:01,200
We love you, Lutz! Come on!

457
00:29:01,283 --> 00:29:04,077
We love you, Lutz! Everybody!

458
00:29:04,161 --> 00:29:08,123
We love you, Lutz!
We love you, Lutz!

459
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,792
We love you, Lutz!
We love you, Lutz!

460
00:29:11,376 --> 00:29:14,963
Whoa!

461
00:29:27,351 --> 00:29:28,411
Yeah!

462
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,652
- Yay!
- Yeah! Way to go, Lutz!

463
00:29:36,735 --> 00:29:38,904
Yeah, Lutz!

464
00:29:38,987 --> 00:29:40,572
That was amazing, Lutz!

465
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,868
Yeah! Yeah! Yes!

466
00:29:44,952 --> 00:29:47,162
Whoo-hoo!

467
00:29:48,747 --> 00:29:49,748
Oh.

468
00:29:54,628 --> 00:29:57,589
Whoo-hoo! What a comeback.

469
00:29:57,673 --> 00:30:00,342
Check out who found
the gift shop.

470
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:01,969
- Whoo!
- I gotta admit,

471
00:30:02,052 --> 00:30:03,345
that was pretty cool.

472
00:30:03,428 --> 00:30:05,889
You can see why
I can get all churned up,

473
00:30:05,973 --> 00:30:09,476
but as a cloud puff who used
to come here with her dad,

474
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,854
all these wins mean
a little bit more.

475
00:30:11,937 --> 00:30:13,272
And as a fireball

476
00:30:13,355 --> 00:30:15,691
who's supposed
to take over her dad's shop,

477
00:30:15,774 --> 00:30:17,484
I sure don't want
to let him down,

478
00:30:17,568 --> 00:30:19,027
and I could use a win, too.

479
00:30:20,571 --> 00:30:22,698
Now, I just got to stop water
from coming in.

480
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:25,284
- Water? In Firetown?
- Yeah.

481
00:30:25,367 --> 00:30:27,119
Water was shut off
to there years ago.

482
00:30:27,202 --> 00:30:28,287
Oh, forget the tickets,

483
00:30:28,370 --> 00:30:30,831
I'm gonna have to take apart
your dad's shop

484
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,416
to figure out what's going on.

485
00:30:32,499 --> 00:30:33,500
You can't!

486
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:36,503
My dad put his whole life
into that place.

487
00:30:36,587 --> 00:30:37,689
I bet this is connected

488
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:38,964
to that fluffing leak.

489
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,382
Yeah, we've been trying

490
00:30:40,465 --> 00:30:41,967
to track down a leak
in the city.

491
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,635
It's why I was
in the canal and...

492
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:47,014
Wait, I know where I got
sucked into Ember's shop.

493
00:30:47,097 --> 00:30:48,974
Ember and I could track
the water

494
00:30:49,057 --> 00:30:51,101
from her shop to find
the source of the leak.

495
00:30:51,435 --> 00:30:52,603
Keep talking.

496
00:30:52,686 --> 00:30:55,272
I could call in a city crew
to fix whatever we find.

497
00:30:55,355 --> 00:30:59,026
Yes. And there'd be no need
to touch my dad's shop.

498
00:31:01,278 --> 00:31:02,738
You're lucky
you're a cute couple.

499
00:31:02,821 --> 00:31:04,072
Oh, we're not a...

500
00:31:04,156 --> 00:31:05,157
You got until Friday.

501
00:31:05,240 --> 00:31:06,408
If you can find the leak

502
00:31:06,491 --> 00:31:08,410
and get a crew
to fix it by then,

503
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,745
those tickets are forgiven.

504
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:13,123
If not, your dad's shop
gets shut down.

505
00:31:13,707 --> 00:31:14,791
Whoo-hoo!

506
00:31:14,875 --> 00:31:17,252
Break wind! Break wind!

507
00:31:17,336 --> 00:31:18,420
Thank you.

508
00:31:21,423 --> 00:31:23,592
- Please take all that off.
- But I got you a hat.

509
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,514
Okay.

510
00:31:29,932 --> 00:31:33,435
Just keep out of sight, okay?
It'd be a whole thing.

511
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,103
Now water upstairs?

512
00:31:35,729 --> 00:31:37,272
It's in the walls.

513
00:31:37,523 --> 00:31:38,649
I don't understand.

514
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:41,151
I fix one pipe
and another one leaks.

515
00:31:41,235 --> 00:31:42,402
Water!

516
00:31:45,781 --> 00:31:46,949
How could it be worse?

517
00:31:47,032 --> 00:31:48,200
Now that the water's back,

518
00:31:48,283 --> 00:31:50,911
the pressure is forcing it up
to all your pipes.

519
00:31:50,994 --> 00:31:52,412
We gotta find the source.

520
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:54,748
How did you even end up here?

521
00:31:55,541 --> 00:31:57,292
Well, I was in the canals

522
00:31:57,376 --> 00:31:59,086
<i>checking the doors for leaks,</i>

523
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:00,420
<i>when I found some water</i>

524
00:32:00,504 --> 00:32:01,744
<i>that shouldn't have been there.</i>

525
00:32:02,214 --> 00:32:05,259
Rusty with a hint of motor oil?

526
00:32:06,218 --> 00:32:07,803
<i>There was this whoosh of water.</i>

527
00:32:09,054 --> 00:32:11,014
<i>And I got sucked
into a filtering system.</i>

528
00:32:11,098 --> 00:32:12,516
Help!

529
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,601
<i>But then I heard this explosion.</i>

530
00:32:19,231 --> 00:32:20,941
<i>That's how I ended up
at your place.</i>

531
00:32:21,233 --> 00:32:24,111
Oh, flame!
My temper caused this.

532
00:32:24,194 --> 00:32:25,529
So, we're searching for water

533
00:32:25,612 --> 00:32:27,072
somewhere in a canal?

534
00:32:27,406 --> 00:32:29,116
Those canals go everywhere.

535
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,659
It's why tracking down that leak

536
00:32:30,742 --> 00:32:32,244
has been so dang hard.

537
00:32:32,327 --> 00:32:33,328
The roof.

538
00:32:40,502 --> 00:32:43,005
You might want to step back.

539
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:50,846
Holy dew drop!

540
00:32:50,929 --> 00:32:52,681
Shh. Get in.

541
00:33:18,248 --> 00:33:19,958
Okay, that's where
I got sucked in.

542
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:23,504
More water. Go that way.

543
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:30,719
Yeah, right there.

544
00:33:30,802 --> 00:33:32,846
Mm. Oh!

545
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,306
Nothing weird going on here.

546
00:33:34,389 --> 00:33:36,350
Uh, just a little pruning.

547
00:33:51,532 --> 00:33:53,659
So, uh, what do you do
at the shop?

548
00:33:53,742 --> 00:33:55,452
If you don't mind me asking.

549
00:33:55,661 --> 00:33:57,788
My dad's retiring
and I'll be taking over.

550
00:33:58,205 --> 00:33:59,206
Someday.

551
00:34:00,415 --> 00:34:01,667
When I'm ready.

552
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:03,728
It must be nice knowing
what you're gonna do.

553
00:34:03,752 --> 00:34:06,380
After my dad passed,
I got all, "What's the point?"

554
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,799
Now I just go
from one job to the next.

555
00:34:09,550 --> 00:34:11,176
There's a word in Firish.

556
00:34:11,552 --> 00:34:12,594
<i>Tìshók.</i>

557
00:34:13,095 --> 00:34:15,055
It means embrace
the light while it burns

558
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,932
because it won't
always last forever.

559
00:34:17,850 --> 00:34:21,144
Tee-shook.

560
00:34:21,812 --> 00:34:23,355
Or something like that.

561
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:30,153
- You okay?
- Yeah.

562
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:31,864
You sure?

563
00:34:32,781 --> 00:34:35,826
It's just,
that building over there,

564
00:34:36,285 --> 00:34:38,078
that's Garden Central Station.

565
00:34:38,662 --> 00:34:40,956
When I was a kid,
my dad took me there

566
00:34:41,039 --> 00:34:43,292
<i>because they had
a Vivisteria tree.</i>

567
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:46,461
<i>I'd always wanted to see one.</i>

568
00:34:47,129 --> 00:34:50,007
<i>It's the only flower that can
thrive in any environment.</i>

569
00:34:51,758 --> 00:34:53,010
<i>Fire included.</i>

570
00:34:54,011 --> 00:34:55,888
<i>I was so excited.</i>

571
00:34:55,971 --> 00:34:58,182
<i>But they said our fire
was too dangerous,</i>

572
00:34:59,099 --> 00:35:00,559
<i>and they wouldn't let us in.</i>

573
00:35:00,642 --> 00:35:03,604
Go back to Fire Land.

574
00:35:03,687 --> 00:35:05,314
<i>My dad was so angry...</i>

575
00:35:05,397 --> 00:35:07,482
- Burn somewhere else!
- Get outta here!

576
00:35:07,566 --> 00:35:08,859
<i>And embarrassed.</i>

577
00:35:09,401 --> 00:35:11,403
The building flooded
a few years later.

578
00:35:11,486 --> 00:35:14,448
So, I missed my one chance
to see a Vivisteria.

579
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,662
You must have been so scared.

580
00:35:22,706 --> 00:35:23,874
I was.

581
00:35:25,292 --> 00:35:27,503
How do you do that?

582
00:35:27,586 --> 00:35:29,421
- Do what?
- Draw people in?

583
00:35:29,505 --> 00:35:31,507
You got a whole stadium
to connect with you.

584
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:34,593
I... I can't even connect
with one customer.

585
00:35:34,676 --> 00:35:36,720
My stupid temper
always kicks in.

586
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,097
I guess I just say what I feel.

587
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:41,391
And I don't think
a temper is so bad.

588
00:35:41,475 --> 00:35:43,560
Sometimes when I lose my temper,

589
00:35:43,644 --> 00:35:44,978
I think it's just me trying

590
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:46,742
to tell me something
I'm not ready to hear.

591
00:35:47,064 --> 00:35:48,273
That's ridiculous.

592
00:35:49,107 --> 00:35:50,108
Maybe.

593
00:35:50,776 --> 00:35:51,777
Hey, there.

594
00:35:52,027 --> 00:35:53,195
Put us down there.

595
00:35:58,951 --> 00:36:00,244
That's not right.

596
00:36:03,789 --> 00:36:04,790
Motor oil.

597
00:36:04,873 --> 00:36:06,542
Yup, this is the source.

598
00:36:07,835 --> 00:36:08,961
Why is there no water?

599
00:36:09,044 --> 00:36:10,504
Because the doors are broken.

600
00:36:10,587 --> 00:36:12,506
This is supposed
to catch spill over

601
00:36:12,589 --> 00:36:14,509
from those main canals and...

602
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:21,014
Run for your life!

603
00:36:25,894 --> 00:36:28,105
Help!

604
00:36:28,605 --> 00:36:29,606
Uh...

605
00:36:30,065 --> 00:36:31,567
Grab this!

606
00:36:40,325 --> 00:36:41,368
Firetown.

607
00:36:50,294 --> 00:36:51,920
Catch!

608
00:37:14,443 --> 00:37:16,570
Ember, throw me more!

609
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:28,665
Whew.

610
00:37:29,249 --> 00:37:31,293
So, will this hold?

611
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:33,837
Yup.
It should for sure.

612
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,380
At least long enough for me

613
00:37:35,464 --> 00:37:37,633
to get a city crew
to fix it before Friday.

614
00:37:39,051 --> 00:37:40,761
- What?
- You've got a little

615
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:41,970
sand.

616
00:37:42,304 --> 00:37:43,305
Oh.

617
00:37:43,388 --> 00:37:44,932
Here? Here?

618
00:37:45,682 --> 00:37:46,892
It's right there.

619
00:37:48,435 --> 00:37:49,603
Um...

620
00:37:50,312 --> 00:37:51,605
Oh.

621
00:37:51,688 --> 00:37:53,315
Thanks.

622
00:37:55,609 --> 00:37:58,362
Well, let me know
when it's done, I guess.

623
00:37:58,445 --> 00:38:00,697
I'll make sure there's
a city crew here by Friday.

624
00:38:01,323 --> 00:38:02,449
Okay.

625
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,409
- See ya.
- Wait.

626
00:38:06,078 --> 00:38:08,330
Any chance you're free tomorrow?

627
00:38:09,289 --> 00:38:12,459
To hang out with a Water guy?

628
00:38:12,543 --> 00:38:15,546
With a Water guy?
My dad would boil you alive.

629
00:38:15,629 --> 00:38:17,798
He doesn't have to know.
We can meet in the city.

630
00:38:17,881 --> 00:38:19,883
I promise, nothing weird.

631
00:38:19,967 --> 00:38:21,844
Maybe a little pruning?

632
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:25,097
Sorry,
that's not going to happen.

633
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,890
You smiled. I saw it.

634
00:38:27,432 --> 00:38:30,894
Tomorrow, I'll be
at the Alkali Theater. -00!

635
00:38:32,104 --> 00:38:33,706
Yeah because then you know
with the light...

636
00:38:33,730 --> 00:38:36,400
Oh! Your ceiling
is dripping again.

637
00:38:36,483 --> 00:38:37,568
More leaks?

638
00:38:37,651 --> 00:38:40,863
Don't worry. This whole
problem is going away.

639
00:38:41,446 --> 00:38:42,781
I can feel it.

640
00:38:46,285 --> 00:38:47,953
And since we're all good,

641
00:38:48,036 --> 00:38:50,789
I am also going away
to do deliveries.

642
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:55,169
Do I smell something on Ember?

643
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:58,898
Yo, Ember.

644
00:38:58,922 --> 00:39:00,924
- Clod.
- I grew another one.

645
00:39:01,008 --> 00:39:02,885
Ow.

646
00:39:02,968 --> 00:39:04,511
My queen.

647
00:39:06,054 --> 00:39:07,598
Oops, sorry, but gotta go.

648
00:39:19,234 --> 00:39:21,695
<i>Started out on a one-way train</i>

649
00:39:21,778 --> 00:39:24,323
<i>Always knew where
I was gonna go next</i>

650
00:39:24,406 --> 00:39:26,950
<i>Didn't know until I saw your face</i>

651
00:39:27,034 --> 00:39:28,952
<i>I was missing out on every moment</i>

652
00:39:29,661 --> 00:39:32,122
<i>You'll be one and baby I'll be two</i>

653
00:39:32,206 --> 00:39:35,042
<i>Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?</i>

654
00:39:36,126 --> 00:39:37,461
<i>I'm into you</i>

655
00:39:38,837 --> 00:39:41,507
<i>So if it's real</i>

656
00:39:41,590 --> 00:39:45,135
<i>Then, darlin', let me know</i>

657
00:39:49,264 --> 00:39:52,518
<i>I wouldn't mind</i>

658
00:39:52,601 --> 00:39:55,437
<i>If you steal the show</i>

659
00:40:05,697 --> 00:40:08,450
<i>You and I, we go together</i>

660
00:40:08,534 --> 00:40:10,911
<i>You're the sky
I'll be the weather</i>

661
00:40:10,994 --> 00:40:13,872
<i>A pretty thing, the sunny rain
who knew?</i>

662
00:40:14,456 --> 00:40:16,333
<i>Oh-oh-oh, yeah</i>

663
00:40:16,416 --> 00:40:18,544
<i>Summer night, perfect occasion</i>

664
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:22,339
<i>Where am I?
You know I'll be waitin' for you</i>

665
00:40:23,465 --> 00:40:25,425
<i>Oh, for you</i>

666
00:40:25,509 --> 00:40:28,512
<i>So if it's real</i>

667
00:40:28,595 --> 00:40:31,807
<i>Then, darlin', let me know</i>

668
00:40:35,811 --> 00:40:37,020

<i>If you steal the show</i>

670
00:40:40,232 --> 00:40:41,984
Who is this guy?

671
00:40:42,067 --> 00:40:44,194
<i>Shine</i>

672
00:40:44,278 --> 00:40:46,321
<i>You shine</i>

673
00:40:46,405 --> 00:40:47,948
<i>Like forever</i>

674
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:50,367
<i>Lasts forever</i>

675
00:40:52,077 --> 00:40:54,454
<i>You shine</i>

676
00:40:54,538 --> 00:40:57,875
<i>You shine and steal the show</i>

677
00:41:01,837 --> 00:41:04,548
<i>So if it's real</i>

678
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:08,343
<i>Then, darlin', let me know</i>

679
00:41:12,222 --> 00:41:15,225
<i>I wouldn't mind</i>

680
00:41:15,309 --> 00:41:18,687
<i>If you steal the show</i>

681
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:20,647
<i>Started out on a one way train</i>

682
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:22,482
<i>Always knew where

00:41:22,566 --> 00:41:24,985
<i>So if it's real</i>

684
00:41:26,111 --> 00:41:28,030
<i>Then, darlin', let me know</i>

685
00:41:29,198 --> 00:41:30,199
Whoa.

686
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:32,910
How'd you do that?

687
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:35,704
It's the minerals.
Check this out.

688
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,124
Awesome.

689
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,968
Wow.
Watch this.

690
00:43:00,455 --> 00:43:02,207
Another?

691
00:43:09,673 --> 00:43:10,841
No, no, no, no, no!

692
00:43:10,924 --> 00:43:12,342
The water is back.

693
00:43:19,349 --> 00:43:20,434
Ember Lumen.

694
00:43:20,517 --> 00:43:22,936
Delivery for Ember Lumen.

695
00:43:23,020 --> 00:43:25,272
Flowers for Ember?

696
00:43:29,610 --> 00:43:32,362
Oh, excuse me.
These are so beautiful.

697
00:43:32,446 --> 00:43:33,655
I'm gonna go put these away.

698
00:43:38,452 --> 00:43:39,536
What are you doing here?

699
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:42,206
I got bad news.
The sandbags didn't hold.

700
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,498
Uh, obviously.

701
00:43:43,582 --> 00:43:46,210
Yeah. And I also
got worse news.

702
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,795
I'd forgotten a tiny detail

703
00:43:48,879 --> 00:43:50,714
about the last time
I saw that city crew.

704
00:43:50,797 --> 00:43:53,550
You knocked over three tons
of cement dust.

705
00:43:53,634 --> 00:43:55,928
Half the guys
still haven't recovered.

706
00:43:57,179 --> 00:44:00,516
I guess you could say
they still have hard feelings

707
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:02,309
because they won't help us.

708
00:44:02,392 --> 00:44:04,645
Wade, Gale's deadline
is tomorrow.

709
00:44:04,728 --> 00:44:05,979
We need more sandbags.

710
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:07,439
But that didn't work before.

711
00:44:07,523 --> 00:44:09,191
Well, I can't just do nothing.

712
00:44:09,274 --> 00:44:10,943
Ember, did you fix leak?

713
00:44:11,026 --> 00:44:13,153
- It's you again.
- Who? Me?

714
00:44:13,237 --> 00:44:14,696
You're the guy
who started all this.

715
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,823
No, Dad. Different guy.

716
00:44:17,324 --> 00:44:18,867
Not all Water looks alike.

717
00:44:18,951 --> 00:44:20,786
You are city inspector?

718
00:44:20,869 --> 00:44:22,329
- Uh...
- No.

719
00:44:22,412 --> 00:44:23,497
Right?

720
00:44:23,580 --> 00:44:26,458
Right! I am not an inspector.

721
00:44:28,919 --> 00:44:30,254
You are inspector.

722
00:44:30,337 --> 00:44:33,173
Why you poking around?
Is this because of water leak?

723
00:44:33,257 --> 00:44:36,343
No. Not because of water
in any way.

724
00:44:36,426 --> 00:44:39,012
He's a different
kind of inspector.

725
00:44:39,096 --> 00:44:40,097
Right?

726
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:41,974
Yeah. Yeah. I'm a...

727
00:44:42,057 --> 00:44:44,852
I'm a food inspector.

728
00:44:44,935 --> 00:44:47,479
I've come to inspect your food.

729
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,440
Hmm. I think he's lying
through his feet.

730
00:44:50,524 --> 00:44:52,150
- Teeth.
- Whatever.

731
00:44:52,234 --> 00:44:53,735
Food upstairs. Come.

732
00:44:53,819 --> 00:44:55,195
Food inspector?

733
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,280
I panicked.

734
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,617
You really food inspector?

735
00:45:00,701 --> 00:45:02,286
As far as you know, yeah.

736
00:45:03,370 --> 00:45:05,372
Then inspect this.

737
00:45:06,206 --> 00:45:07,475
- Dad.
<i>- </i><i>Ê shútsh!</i>

738
00:45:09,418 --> 00:45:10,878
Yep, all looks good to me.

739
00:45:10,961 --> 00:45:14,631
No, no, no, no, no.
Inspect with your mouth.

740
00:45:30,230 --> 00:45:31,231
Ah.

741
00:45:44,620 --> 00:45:46,997
You see? He likes it.

742
00:45:49,291 --> 00:45:51,919
You must try these.
Straight from Fire Land.

743
00:45:52,002 --> 00:45:53,545
Dad, those are too hot.

744
00:45:53,629 --> 00:45:55,672
I'm okay.
I love hot food.

745
00:45:55,756 --> 00:45:57,090
Um.

746
00:46:02,930 --> 00:46:04,890
Hey! Watch your water.

747
00:46:04,973 --> 00:46:06,475
So, did we pass?

748
00:46:06,558 --> 00:46:08,810
Mm-hmm. A plus.

749
00:46:10,062 --> 00:46:12,397
Actually,
after the heat dies down,

750
00:46:12,481 --> 00:46:13,982
that's really good.

751
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:16,109
If you don't mind.

752
00:46:19,321 --> 00:46:20,405
Mm-mm!

753
00:46:25,702 --> 00:46:28,622
See? It's really tasty
if you water it down a little.

754
00:46:28,914 --> 00:46:30,457
Water us down?

755
00:46:30,874 --> 00:46:32,125
Water us down?

756
00:46:32,209 --> 00:46:33,961
Where's camera?

757
00:46:34,044 --> 00:46:37,256
We will never be watered
down by you. Get out!

758
00:46:37,339 --> 00:46:38,715
All right, sir, you gotta go.

759
00:46:41,343 --> 00:46:43,095
Dad, don't worry.
I've got this.

760
00:46:45,013 --> 00:46:46,557
Look, meet me at the beach

761
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:47,933
and we'll make more sandbags.

762
00:46:48,016 --> 00:46:50,102
We have to figure out
how to fix those doors.

763
00:46:50,185 --> 00:46:52,312
Water want to water us down?

764
00:46:52,980 --> 00:46:55,732
Then Water no longer
allowed in shop.

765
00:46:55,816 --> 00:46:57,526
He is panned.

766
00:46:57,609 --> 00:46:59,236
Um, banned.

767
00:46:59,319 --> 00:47:01,822
Banned!

768
00:47:01,905 --> 00:47:03,907
<i>Àshfá,</i> it's okay.

769
00:47:03,991 --> 00:47:07,452
It's all going to be okay.

770
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,188
I don't think

771
00:47:17,212 --> 00:47:18,213
this is going to work.

772
00:47:18,297 --> 00:47:20,674
Well, it won't unless
you hold the bag straight.

773
00:47:20,757 --> 00:47:22,384
Maybe your dad will understand.

774
00:47:23,719 --> 00:47:24,803
I'm serious.

775
00:47:24,887 --> 00:47:26,805
Look, I know it can be tough.

776
00:47:26,889 --> 00:47:30,100
I mean, with my dad,
we were like oil and water.

777
00:47:30,684 --> 00:47:32,477
I never got a chance
to fix that.

778
00:47:33,270 --> 00:47:34,438
But you guys are different.

779
00:47:36,023 --> 00:47:37,608
It might be time to tell him.

780
00:47:37,691 --> 00:47:39,818
Yeah, right.
And tell him what?

781
00:47:39,902 --> 00:47:42,696
That I got us shut down
and destroyed his dream?

782
00:47:52,789 --> 00:47:54,416
I think I'm failing.

783
00:47:56,084 --> 00:47:58,504
My <i>Àshfá</i> should
have retired years ago,

784
00:47:58,587 --> 00:48:00,005
but he doesn't think I'm ready.

785
00:48:01,340 --> 00:48:04,760
You have no idea
how hard they've worked.

786
00:48:05,469 --> 00:48:07,095
Or what they've had to endure.

787
00:48:07,888 --> 00:48:09,681
Family they left behind.

788
00:48:10,432 --> 00:48:13,268
How do you repay
a sacrifice that big?

789
00:48:13,644 --> 00:48:15,521
It all feels like a burden.

790
00:48:15,604 --> 00:48:17,105
How can I say that?

791
00:48:17,606 --> 00:48:19,149
I'm a bad daughter.

792
00:48:19,233 --> 00:48:20,776
Hey, no.

793
00:48:20,859 --> 00:48:22,319
You're doing your best.

794
00:48:24,404 --> 00:48:25,489
I'm a mess.

795
00:48:26,073 --> 00:48:28,742
Nah. I think
you're even more beautiful.

796
00:48:40,629 --> 00:48:41,909
Maybe you're right when you said

797
00:48:41,964 --> 00:48:44,758
my temper is me trying
to tell me something.

798
00:48:46,051 --> 00:48:47,052
Whoa.

799
00:48:47,678 --> 00:48:50,013
Look what your fire did
to the sand.

800
00:48:50,889 --> 00:48:52,558
It's glass.

801
00:49:01,275 --> 00:49:04,361
It looks like
a Vivisteria flower.

802
00:49:06,446 --> 00:49:08,365
I know how to seal those doors.

803
00:49:28,385 --> 00:49:29,386
Yes.

804
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:42,900
Are you crying?

805
00:49:42,983 --> 00:49:44,276
Yes.

806
00:49:44,359 --> 00:49:46,528
I've just never been punched
in the face

807
00:49:46,612 --> 00:49:47,905
with beauty before.

808
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:03,212
It worked!

809
00:50:03,295 --> 00:50:05,047
I'll have Gale come by
right after work.

810
00:50:05,130 --> 00:50:07,049
I'll let you know the second
I hear anything.

811
00:50:07,132 --> 00:50:08,610
You think this will be
good enough for her?

812
00:50:08,634 --> 00:50:12,137
Honestly, it's hard to know.
She could go either way.

813
00:50:12,596 --> 00:50:13,597
Oh.

814
00:50:14,765 --> 00:50:16,642
Here. I saved this for you.

815
00:50:18,352 --> 00:50:19,645
It's special.

816
00:50:33,617 --> 00:50:35,410
<i>Àshfá,</i> you okay?

817
00:50:35,494 --> 00:50:38,664
Yes, yes.
Just too much to fix.

818
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:39,957
I'll take care of it.

819
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,417
You need to rest,
and that's an order.

820
00:50:42,501 --> 00:50:43,585
Yes, ma'am.

821
00:50:46,296 --> 00:50:48,841
Ember, I see a change in you.

822
00:50:48,924 --> 00:50:51,760
Happier, calmer with customers

823
00:50:51,844 --> 00:50:54,596
and with that food inspector.

824
00:50:55,347 --> 00:50:57,516
Always putting shop first.

825
00:50:58,725 --> 00:51:00,936
You prove I can trust you.

826
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:09,820
I'm so lucky I have you.

827
00:51:23,959 --> 00:51:24,960
Love?

828
00:51:44,730 --> 00:51:46,899
Ember, you found it.
Everything okay?

829
00:51:46,982 --> 00:51:49,318
Please tell me that you have
some good news from Gale.

830
00:51:49,401 --> 00:51:51,528
I'm getting really worried
about my dad.

831
00:51:51,612 --> 00:51:52,988
This has to break my way.

832
00:51:53,071 --> 00:51:54,573
Yeah, I haven't heard
from her yet,

833
00:51:54,656 --> 00:51:56,491
but she swore
she'd call tonight.

834
00:51:56,575 --> 00:51:58,869
Actually, my family
stopped by for dinner.

835
00:51:58,952 --> 00:52:01,163
You want to come up and wait
for the call together?

836
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:02,664
Your family?

837
00:52:05,709 --> 00:52:08,337
Um...

838
00:52:08,420 --> 00:52:10,797
Okay. I'll...
I'll come up for a bit.

839
00:52:12,132 --> 00:52:13,884
I'm sorry, you live here?

840
00:52:13,967 --> 00:52:14,968
It's my mom's place.

841
00:52:15,052 --> 00:52:16,053
Oh, my gosh!

842
00:52:19,014 --> 00:52:22,768
I'm afraid I can't let you in.
Residents and guests only.

843
00:52:22,851 --> 00:52:25,854
Ah! Okay. I understand.

844
00:52:29,358 --> 00:52:31,443
You're surprisingly good
at your job.

845
00:52:31,527 --> 00:52:33,612
You're surprisingly fast
for your age.

846
00:52:33,695 --> 00:52:35,656
You have no idea.

847
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:40,494
Ember! Oh, I'm so excited
to finally meet you.

848
00:52:40,953 --> 00:52:43,372
Do we hug, or wave, or...?

849
00:52:43,455 --> 00:52:45,040
Don't want to put you out.

850
00:52:45,123 --> 00:52:47,042
Um, a hello is fine.

851
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,586
Hardly. Wade hasn't stopped
talking about you

852
00:52:49,670 --> 00:52:50,796
since the day you met.

853
00:52:50,879 --> 00:52:52,756
- The boy is smitten.
- Mom.

854
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,591
Oh, come on. I'm your mother.

855
00:52:54,675 --> 00:52:56,552
I know when something's
lighting you up.

856
00:52:56,635 --> 00:52:59,346
I just didn't know
she'd be so smoky.

857
00:53:03,141 --> 00:53:05,018
Come this way,
meet the rest of the family.

858
00:53:09,773 --> 00:53:11,149
- Hmm.
- Oh.

859
00:53:17,489 --> 00:53:18,949
Oh, honey, you won't believe

860
00:53:19,032 --> 00:53:20,093
what your baby niece did today.

861
00:53:20,117 --> 00:53:21,994
She... She smiled.

862
00:53:22,077 --> 00:53:23,912
No, she didn't.

863
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:27,541
Yeah.

864
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:31,044
Hey, everyone, this is Ember.

865
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:32,504
Hey!

866
00:53:32,588 --> 00:53:34,840
That's my brother Alan
and his wife Eddy.

867
00:53:34,923 --> 00:53:36,717
- Hi.
- And we got two kids

868
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:38,236
that are swimmin'
around here somewhere.

869
00:53:38,260 --> 00:53:40,387
Marco! Polo!

870
00:53:40,804 --> 00:53:42,264
What?

871
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:43,682
Hi, Uncle Wade!

872
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:44,975
Do you die if you fall

873
00:53:45,058 --> 00:53:46,518
- in water?
- Whoa!

874
00:53:46,602 --> 00:53:48,520
- Marco!
- Kids, right?

875
00:53:48,604 --> 00:53:49,938
Don't hate us.

876
00:53:50,022 --> 00:53:51,857
Anyway, that's my little sib,
Lake,

877
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:53,734
- and her girlfriend, Ghibli.
- 'Sup!

878
00:53:53,817 --> 00:53:56,278
They're students at Element
City School for the Arts.

879
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:57,738
Yeah. Following in Mom's wake.

880
00:53:57,821 --> 00:53:59,865
Oh, nonsense.
I'm just an architect.

881
00:53:59,948 --> 00:54:02,034
The real artist
is my brother, Harold.

882
00:54:02,117 --> 00:54:05,078
Oh, I just dabble
in watercolors.

883
00:54:05,162 --> 00:54:07,789
Or as we like
to call them, "colors."

884
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:10,709
Oh, don't listen to him.
He's a wonderful painter.

885
00:54:10,792 --> 00:54:11,960
One of his paintings just got

886
00:54:12,044 --> 00:54:14,087
in the Element City Museum's
permanent collection.

887
00:54:14,171 --> 00:54:15,839
Wow, that is so cool.

888
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:18,258
My only talent
is "Clean up on aisle four."

889
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:19,652
Talk about being modest.

890
00:54:19,676 --> 00:54:21,762
Ember's got an incredible
creative flame.

891
00:54:21,845 --> 00:54:23,263
I've never seen
anything like it.

892
00:54:23,347 --> 00:54:27,809
I just have to say that
you speak so well and clear.

893
00:54:29,561 --> 00:54:30,687
Yeah, it's amazing

894
00:54:30,771 --> 00:54:31,998
what talking
in the same language

895
00:54:32,022 --> 00:54:33,315
your entire life can do.

896
00:54:33,398 --> 00:54:34,942
- Oh!
- Uh, hey, Ember,

897
00:54:35,025 --> 00:54:36,902
did, uh, Wadey here
ever tell you

898
00:54:36,985 --> 00:54:38,820
that he's deathly afraid
of sponges?

899
00:54:38,904 --> 00:54:41,490
- No.
- I was traumatized.

900
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:44,034
Huh?

901
00:54:44,117 --> 00:54:45,118
Huh.

902
00:54:51,291 --> 00:54:53,293
I still can't use a sponge
around him.

903
00:54:53,377 --> 00:54:55,212
I was stuck in there for hours.

904
00:54:56,463 --> 00:54:58,423
- Oh.
- Alan! That was new.

905
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:00,843
My bad.
I'm all whirlpools tonight.

906
00:55:00,926 --> 00:55:01,927
I can fix it.

907
00:55:22,072 --> 00:55:23,407
Oh, um...

908
00:55:24,283 --> 00:55:25,284
Sorry.

909
00:55:26,201 --> 00:55:28,245
That was incredible!

910
00:55:29,746 --> 00:55:31,039
It's just melted glass.

911
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:32,457
Just melted glass?

912
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:33,876
Every building in the new city

913
00:55:33,959 --> 00:55:36,086
is built from just melted glass.

914
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:38,213
Oh, no, you have to do
something with that talent.

915
00:55:39,590 --> 00:55:42,217
See, I told you, you're special.

916
00:55:46,513 --> 00:55:47,639
Ooh, thought bubble.

917
00:55:47,723 --> 00:55:50,976
Maybe after dinner we play
The Crying Game?

918
00:55:51,059 --> 00:55:52,477
Yes, yes, yes.

919
00:55:52,561 --> 00:55:54,938
Let me guess, you try to cry?

920
00:55:55,022 --> 00:55:57,232
We try not to cry.

921
00:55:57,316 --> 00:55:59,318
You have one minute. Go!

922
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,323
1979. November. You were...

923
00:56:07,284 --> 00:56:10,829
Never got a chance
to say goodbye to Nana.

924
00:56:12,706 --> 00:56:13,957
Damn, you're good.

925
00:56:14,041 --> 00:56:16,376
Okay, Ember, Wade, you're up.

926
00:56:18,003 --> 00:56:19,796
Yeah, this is almost unfair

927
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:22,591
because I have
literally never cried.

928
00:56:22,674 --> 00:56:24,134
You got no chance.

929
00:56:24,218 --> 00:56:25,761
Sounds like a challenge.

930
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,013
Ready, go!

931
00:56:28,096 --> 00:56:30,933
Butterfly, windshield wipers,

932
00:56:31,016 --> 00:56:32,893
half a butterfly.

933
00:56:37,689 --> 00:56:38,690
Okay.

934
00:56:39,149 --> 00:56:41,026
An old man on his deathbed

935
00:56:41,109 --> 00:56:43,403
remembers the summer
he fell in love.

936
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:46,365
She was out of his league
and he was young and scared.

937
00:56:47,699 --> 00:56:50,285
He let her go, thinking surely
summer would come again.

938
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:53,330
It never did.

939
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:56,667
Almost out of time.

940
00:56:59,795 --> 00:57:00,796
Ember,

941
00:57:01,755 --> 00:57:04,508
when I met you,
I thought I was drowning.

942
00:57:05,634 --> 00:57:07,302
But that light,

943
00:57:07,636 --> 00:57:11,515
that light inside you
has made me feel so alive.

944
00:57:13,559 --> 00:57:16,186
And all I want now
is to be near it.

945
00:57:17,563 --> 00:57:18,564
Near you.

946
00:57:19,314 --> 00:57:20,440
<i>Together.</i>

947
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,550
Aw.

948
00:57:50,387 --> 00:57:52,181
Hello? Gale, hi.

949
00:57:52,264 --> 00:57:54,975
Glass? You repaired it
with glass?

950
00:57:55,058 --> 00:57:56,059
- Hold the storm.
- Hey!

951
00:57:58,687 --> 00:58:01,857
Tempered glass.
Solid as a rock, I like it.

952
00:58:01,940 --> 00:58:04,234
Consider the tickets cancelled.

953
00:58:05,944 --> 00:58:07,571
- We did it?
- Yup!

954
00:58:09,698 --> 00:58:12,201
Awesome! Whoo!

955
00:58:12,284 --> 00:58:13,952
- Oh.
- Oh. Um...

956
00:58:15,913 --> 00:58:17,331
Thank you, Mrs. Ripple.

957
00:58:17,915 --> 00:58:19,082
This was...

958
00:58:19,791 --> 00:58:20,876
This was really great.

959
00:58:20,959 --> 00:58:22,044
Yeah, it was.

960
00:58:22,127 --> 00:58:24,546
And I mean what I said
about your talent.

961
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:25,631
I have a friend who runs

962
00:58:25,714 --> 00:58:28,091
the best glassmaking firm
in the world.

963
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:30,511
During dinner, I slipped out
and I made a call

964
00:58:30,594 --> 00:58:32,804
and I told her about you.

965
00:58:32,888 --> 00:58:34,181
They're looking for an intern.

966
00:58:34,264 --> 00:58:36,433
It could be
an amazing opportunity.

967
00:58:36,517 --> 00:58:37,559
For real?

968
00:58:37,643 --> 00:58:38,703
It's a long way from the city,

969
00:58:38,727 --> 00:58:40,646
but it would be
an incredible start.

970
00:58:40,729 --> 00:58:42,773
You have a bright future.

971
00:58:43,357 --> 00:58:46,151
Look at me,
I have an original Ember.

972
00:58:48,237 --> 00:58:49,821
Hold up, I'll walk you out.

973
00:58:51,573 --> 00:58:53,992
I'm afraid you're going to have

974
00:58:54,076 --> 00:58:55,536
to wait out here, ma'am.

975
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:58,038
And I'm afraid...

976
00:58:58,121 --> 00:58:59,540
I will throw up.

977
00:59:07,589 --> 00:59:08,674
Ember.

978
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:10,050
Ember, hold up, what's going on?

979
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,135
I can't believe she basically
offered me a job.

980
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:14,096
I know! Could be cool.

981
00:59:14,179 --> 00:59:15,180
Yeah, super cool, Wade.

982
00:59:15,264 --> 00:59:16,515
I could move out and make glass

983
00:59:16,598 --> 00:59:18,392
in a faraway city.
Do whatever I want.

984
00:59:18,767 --> 00:59:20,811
- I don't understand.
- I'm going home.

985
00:59:20,894 --> 00:59:22,094
Fine, then I'm going with you.

986
00:59:25,023 --> 00:59:26,942
A Water guy?

987
00:59:31,780 --> 00:59:34,324
Look, my mom was
just trying to be helpful.

988
00:59:34,908 --> 00:59:36,118
She doesn't know how excited

989
00:59:36,201 --> 00:59:38,054
you are to run the shop.

990
00:59:38,078 --> 00:59:40,080
- What is the matter?
- Nothing!

991
00:59:40,163 --> 00:59:42,332
Yeah? 'Cause we're going,
like, a thousand...

992
00:59:42,416 --> 00:59:43,458
Bus!

993
00:59:47,087 --> 00:59:49,047
You don't know me, Wade. Okay?

994
00:59:49,131 --> 00:59:50,757
So stop pretending like you do.

995
00:59:50,841 --> 00:59:51,967
What is this about?

996
00:59:52,050 --> 00:59:53,093
Nothing.

997
00:59:53,177 --> 00:59:55,012
Everything.
I don't know. It's...

998
01:00:00,434 --> 01:00:04,229
I don't think I actually
do want to run the shop. Okay?

999
01:00:06,523 --> 01:00:09,151
That's what my temper
has been trying to tell me.

1000
01:00:11,528 --> 01:00:12,738
I'm trapped.

1001
01:00:15,324 --> 01:00:17,451
You know what's crazy?

1002
01:00:17,534 --> 01:00:18,952
Even when I was a kid,

1003
01:00:19,036 --> 01:00:20,495
I would pray to the Blue Flame

1004
01:00:20,579 --> 01:00:23,123
to be good enough to fill
my father's shoes someday

1005
01:00:23,540 --> 01:00:25,584
because this place is his dream.

1006
01:00:26,502 --> 01:00:28,462
But I never once asked...

1007
01:00:30,214 --> 01:00:31,798
what I wanted to do.

1008
01:00:34,885 --> 01:00:37,387
I think that's
because deep down,

1009
01:00:37,471 --> 01:00:39,306
I knew it didn't matter.

1010
01:00:41,058 --> 01:00:44,269
Because the only way
to repay a sacrifice so big

1011
01:00:45,604 --> 01:00:48,148
is by sacrificing your life too.

1012
01:00:50,400 --> 01:00:51,652
Ember!

1013
01:00:51,735 --> 01:00:53,403
Don't move.

1014
01:00:53,487 --> 01:00:54,571
Oh, blaze! My mother.

1015
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:05,249
Mom, it's okay.
He's just a friend.

1016
01:01:05,582 --> 01:01:06,750
Si...

1017
01:01:06,834 --> 01:01:07,835
Silence!

1018
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:09,962
I could smell you

1019
01:01:10,045 --> 01:01:12,172
from over there.
Oh, you stink.

1020
01:01:12,256 --> 01:01:13,715
What are you talking about?

1021
01:01:13,799 --> 01:01:16,718
You know what I'm talking about.

1022
01:01:18,512 --> 01:01:20,681
You're smelling love on me?

1023
01:01:21,390 --> 01:01:23,642
If your father find out...

1024
01:01:24,226 --> 01:01:27,980
Fire and Water
cannot be together.

1025
01:01:28,522 --> 01:01:30,732
I prove it. Come with me.

1026
01:01:33,694 --> 01:01:35,934
I splash this on your heart
to bring love to the surface.

1027
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:41,994
Mmm!

1028
01:01:42,077 --> 01:01:44,955
And then you must light these
with your fire,

1029
01:01:45,038 --> 01:01:46,373
and I read the smoke.

1030
01:01:58,510 --> 01:02:01,138
See, Ember? It cannot be.

1031
01:02:04,766 --> 01:02:05,934
Actually...

1032
01:02:08,103 --> 01:02:09,104
What are you doing?

1033
01:02:42,387 --> 01:02:43,388
Cinder?

1034
01:02:43,472 --> 01:02:44,552
Who down there?

1035
01:02:44,598 --> 01:02:46,225
It's my dad. You have to go.

1036
01:02:48,560 --> 01:02:50,229
Wait, are we a match?

1037
01:02:50,312 --> 01:02:52,856
What's going on?
I wake up and nobody upstairs.

1038
01:02:52,940 --> 01:02:53,941
It was just me.

1039
01:02:55,442 --> 01:02:58,195
I was double-checking the locks.

1040
01:02:58,278 --> 01:02:59,738
And Mom came down and...

1041
01:02:59,821 --> 01:03:04,159
Yes, and we, uh, began
looking at this door.

1042
01:03:04,243 --> 01:03:05,994
We don't talk
about this door enough.

1043
01:03:06,078 --> 01:03:07,198
Pull it together.

1044
01:03:07,246 --> 01:03:08,956
Well, since you're awake,

1045
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:13,877
I was gonna tell you tomorrow,
but I'm too excited to sleep.

1046
01:03:13,961 --> 01:03:16,421
In two days, I retire.

1047
01:03:16,505 --> 01:03:18,131
- Ooh.
- Oh, Bernie.

1048
01:03:18,215 --> 01:03:19,258
Two days?

1049
01:03:19,341 --> 01:03:22,135
Yes. We're going
to throw big party.

1050
01:03:22,219 --> 01:03:23,679
A grand reopening.

1051
01:03:23,762 --> 01:03:26,056
That way I can tell whole world

1052
01:03:26,139 --> 01:03:28,684
my daughter take over.

1053
01:03:28,767 --> 01:03:31,353
And I have gift for you.

1054
01:03:31,436 --> 01:03:34,439
I've had this for a while,
but after our talk,

1055
01:03:34,523 --> 01:03:36,567
I know now is the time.

1056
01:03:37,192 --> 01:03:38,777
Before I give it to you,

1057
01:03:38,861 --> 01:03:42,364
I need you to understand
what it means to me.

1058
01:03:43,824 --> 01:03:45,200
<i>When I left Fire Land,</i>

1059
01:03:47,286 --> 01:03:49,830
<i>I gave my father the </i>Bà Ksô...

1060
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:52,875
<i>the big bow.</i>

1061
01:03:55,335 --> 01:03:57,880
<i>It is the highest form
of respect.</i>

1062
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:03,468
<i>But my father</i>

1063
01:04:04,178 --> 01:04:06,471
<i>did not return the bow.</i>

1064
01:04:07,598 --> 01:04:09,892
<i>Did not give me his blessing.</i>

1065
01:04:10,851 --> 01:04:13,145
<i>He say, if we leave Fire Land,</i>

1066
01:04:13,562 --> 01:04:15,856
<i>we will lose who we are.</i>

1067
01:04:17,733 --> 01:04:20,068
They never got
to see all of this.

1068
01:04:20,152 --> 01:04:21,320
They didn't get to see

1069
01:04:21,403 --> 01:04:24,656
that I never forgot we are Fire.

1070
01:04:25,115 --> 01:04:28,202
This is burden I still carry.

1071
01:04:28,702 --> 01:04:31,246
Ember, it is important
that you know

1072
01:04:31,330 --> 01:04:35,501
you have my blessing
every day you come in here.

1073
01:04:35,584 --> 01:04:38,378
So I have this made for you.

1074
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:40,672
Wow, <i>Àshfá.</i>

1075
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:44,426
It's gonna be big, bright.

1076
01:04:44,510 --> 01:04:46,261
Everyone's gonna see this.

1077
01:04:46,345 --> 01:04:48,430
"Ember's Fireplace."

1078
01:04:48,514 --> 01:04:50,891
We unveil it at grand reopening.

1079
01:04:52,518 --> 01:04:55,145
Come, Bernie.
You need your rest.

1080
01:05:20,504 --> 01:05:23,799
Ember, so, what'd your mom say
about our reading?

1081
01:05:24,132 --> 01:05:25,217
Nothing.

1082
01:05:25,300 --> 01:05:26,885
Look, I have a gift for you.

1083
01:05:30,305 --> 01:05:33,600
And you came all the way here
to give it to me?

1084
01:05:34,101 --> 01:05:35,936
Wait, why are you
giving me gifts?

1085
01:05:37,521 --> 01:05:40,315
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1086
01:05:40,399 --> 01:05:42,442
Hold on, I think I have
something to show you.

1087
01:05:42,526 --> 01:05:43,902
Just give me two seconds.

1088
01:05:43,986 --> 01:05:45,571
And you're gonna need
a pair of boots.

1089
01:05:49,449 --> 01:05:51,577
Wade, what are we doing here?

1090
01:05:51,660 --> 01:05:52,828
Just wait.

1091
01:06:01,253 --> 01:06:02,629
Why do they even have these?

1092
01:06:02,713 --> 01:06:03,714
Eh, who knows?

1093
01:06:10,929 --> 01:06:13,515
Hey, it's my favorite fireball.

1094
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,851
Hey, Gale. What's going on?

1095
01:06:15,934 --> 01:06:18,562
I know you think
you have to end this,

1096
01:06:18,645 --> 01:06:21,899
but that flooded tunnel,
it goes to the main terminal.

1097
01:06:21,982 --> 01:06:23,275
Okay.

1098
01:06:23,358 --> 01:06:25,444
Do you still want
to see a Vivisteria?

1099
01:06:26,778 --> 01:06:28,238
Gale?

1100
01:06:36,622 --> 01:06:39,082
Wait, I'm supposed
to get in there?

1101
01:06:39,166 --> 01:06:40,292
The air should last...

1102
01:06:40,375 --> 01:06:41,960
At least 20 minutes.

1103
01:06:44,505 --> 01:06:46,340
They said you couldn't
go in there.

1104
01:06:46,423 --> 01:06:48,091
Why does anyone get to tell you

1105
01:06:48,175 --> 01:06:49,593
what you can do in your life?

1106
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,205
Whoa.

1107
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:37,993
A Vivisteria.

1108
01:08:56,720 --> 01:08:57,930
Whoa.

1109
01:09:25,791 --> 01:09:26,792
- Ouch.
- Hey,

1110
01:09:26,875 --> 01:09:28,043
you're running out of air.

1111
01:09:37,427 --> 01:09:40,055
Almost there. Try to breathe
slow and steady.

1112
01:09:53,402 --> 01:09:54,695
I'm so sorry.
I should never...

1113
01:09:54,778 --> 01:09:55,821
Are you kidding?

1114
01:09:55,904 --> 01:09:59,074
That was amazing!
I finally saw a Vivisteria!

1115
01:09:59,950 --> 01:10:01,910
It was inspiring.

1116
01:10:02,327 --> 01:10:03,537
You were inspiring.

1117
01:10:07,624 --> 01:10:09,877
No. Wade, we...
we can't touch.

1118
01:10:10,169 --> 01:10:11,295
Maybe we can.

1119
01:10:11,712 --> 01:10:12,713
No.

1120
01:10:13,547 --> 01:10:14,840
But can't we just prove it?

1121
01:10:14,923 --> 01:10:16,008
Prove what?

1122
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:17,509
Let's see what happens,

1123
01:10:17,593 --> 01:10:18,760
and if it's a disaster,

1124
01:10:18,844 --> 01:10:20,387
then we'll know
this would never work.

1125
01:10:20,470 --> 01:10:22,848
But it actually
could be a disaster.

1126
01:10:22,931 --> 01:10:24,308
I could vaporize you.

1127
01:10:24,391 --> 01:10:26,602
You... You could
extinguish me, and then...

1128
01:10:26,685 --> 01:10:28,729
Let's... Let's start small.

1129
01:12:08,370 --> 01:12:09,997
I'm so lucky.

1130
01:12:14,042 --> 01:12:16,795
I'm so lucky I have you.

1131
01:12:23,719 --> 01:12:24,720
I have to go.

1132
01:12:26,513 --> 01:12:27,931
Wait, what?

1133
01:12:28,015 --> 01:12:29,099
Where are you going?

1134
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:31,143
Back to my life
at the shop where I belong.

1135
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:32,269
I take over tomorrow.

1136
01:12:32,352 --> 01:12:33,729
Whoa, whoa, whoa, hold up.

1137
01:12:33,812 --> 01:12:36,273
You don't want that,
you said so yourself.

1138
01:12:36,356 --> 01:12:37,774
It doesn't matter what I want.

1139
01:12:37,858 --> 01:12:39,443
Of course it does.

1140
01:12:39,526 --> 01:12:40,736
Listen. Listen.

1141
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:41,904
You've got an opportunity

1142
01:12:41,987 --> 01:12:43,739
to do something
you want with your life.

1143
01:12:43,822 --> 01:12:45,115
"Want"?

1144
01:12:45,199 --> 01:12:46,658
Yeah, that may work
in your rich kid,

1145
01:12:46,742 --> 01:12:48,160
"follow your heart" family,

1146
01:12:48,243 --> 01:12:50,662
but getting to do
what you want is a luxury

1147
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:52,456
and not for people like me.

1148
01:12:52,539 --> 01:12:55,334
Why not? Just tell
your father how you feel.

1149
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:57,461
This is too important.
Maybe he'll agree.

1150
01:12:57,544 --> 01:12:59,588
Yeah.

1151
01:13:00,839 --> 01:13:01,924
Funny.

1152
01:13:02,007 --> 01:13:04,885
And this whole time,
I thought you were so strong,

1153
01:13:04,968 --> 01:13:07,888
but turns out
you're just afraid.

1154
01:13:08,555 --> 01:13:10,807
Don't you dare judge me.

1155
01:13:10,891 --> 01:13:12,142
You don't know what it's like

1156
01:13:12,226 --> 01:13:14,478
to have parents who gave up
everything for you.

1157
01:13:16,188 --> 01:13:17,981
I'm Fire, Wade.

1158
01:13:18,065 --> 01:13:19,775
I can't be anything
more than that.

1159
01:13:19,858 --> 01:13:21,985
It's what I am
and what my family is.

1160
01:13:22,069 --> 01:13:23,570
It's our way of life.

1161
01:13:23,946 --> 01:13:27,074
I cannot throw all of that
away just for you.

1162
01:13:28,534 --> 01:13:30,035
I don't understand.

1163
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:31,912
And that alone

1164
01:13:31,995 --> 01:13:33,914
is a reason
this could never work.

1165
01:13:34,873 --> 01:13:36,083
It's over, Wade.

1166
01:14:07,030 --> 01:14:08,740
Everyone, welcome.

1167
01:14:09,408 --> 01:14:11,827
It is good to see your faces.

1168
01:14:11,910 --> 01:14:14,580
I am honored to have served you,

1169
01:14:15,414 --> 01:14:17,291
but it's time to move on.

1170
01:14:18,166 --> 01:14:19,168
Come.

1171
01:14:20,836 --> 01:14:22,254
My daughter,

1172
01:14:22,337 --> 01:14:25,340
you are the Ember
of our family fire.

1173
01:14:26,758 --> 01:14:28,719
That is why I am so proud

1174
01:14:28,802 --> 01:14:31,680
to have you take over
my life's work.

1175
01:14:42,858 --> 01:14:44,568
Pretty good trick, huh?

1176
01:14:45,861 --> 01:14:49,907
This is lantern I bring
from old country.

1177
01:14:50,991 --> 01:14:53,702
Today, I pass it on to you.

1178
01:15:04,129 --> 01:15:05,506
I thought of other reasons.

1179
01:15:10,844 --> 01:15:12,763
Wade?

1180
01:15:12,930 --> 01:15:13,931
Oh, boy.

1181
01:15:14,348 --> 01:15:15,599
What are you doing here?

1182
01:15:15,682 --> 01:15:16,975
You said me not understanding

1183
01:15:17,059 --> 01:15:18,602
is the reason we can never work.

1184
01:15:18,685 --> 01:15:20,229
But I thought of other reasons.

1185
01:15:20,312 --> 01:15:21,313
A bunch of 'em.

1186
01:15:21,730 --> 01:15:24,525
Like, number one,
you're Fire, I'm Water.

1187
01:15:24,608 --> 01:15:26,401
I mean, come on, that's crazy.

1188
01:15:26,485 --> 01:15:27,778
Right?

1189
01:15:27,861 --> 01:15:30,072
- Who is this?
- No idea.

1190
01:15:30,155 --> 01:15:32,241
Number two,
I'm crashing your party.

1191
01:15:32,324 --> 01:15:33,867
Like, what kind of a jerk am I?

1192
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:35,869
- A pretty big one.
- Right?

1193
01:15:35,953 --> 01:15:36,954
Number three,

1194
01:15:37,037 --> 01:15:40,207
I can't eat
your delicious foods.

1195
01:15:42,960 --> 01:15:44,400
Ooh, very unpleasant.

1196
01:15:44,461 --> 01:15:47,130
Wait, I know him.
He is food inspector.

1197
01:15:47,214 --> 01:15:48,715
Oh, right. Number four,

1198
01:15:48,799 --> 01:15:50,801
I'm banned
from your father's shop.

1199
01:15:51,301 --> 01:15:54,680
There are a million reasons
why this can't work.

1200
01:15:54,763 --> 01:15:56,139
A million nos.

1201
01:15:56,223 --> 01:15:58,392
But there's also one yes,

1202
01:15:58,475 --> 01:16:00,435
we touched.

1203
01:16:00,519 --> 01:16:02,646
And when we did,
something happened to us,

1204
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:03,856
something impossible.

1205
01:16:05,190 --> 01:16:07,150
We changed
each other's chemistry.

1206
01:16:07,442 --> 01:16:08,443
Enough!

1207
01:16:08,819 --> 01:16:10,779
What kind of food inspection
is this?

1208
01:16:10,863 --> 01:16:12,906
A food inspection
of the heart, sir.

1209
01:16:12,990 --> 01:16:14,032
Who are you?

1210
01:16:14,116 --> 01:16:15,284
Just a guy who burst

1211
01:16:15,367 --> 01:16:17,619
into your daughter's life
in a flooded old basement.

1212
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,872
So you are the one
who burst the pipes?

1213
01:16:19,955 --> 01:16:21,415
What? Not me. It was...

1214
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:24,126
You?

1215
01:16:25,002 --> 01:16:26,545
You burst the pipe?

1216
01:16:26,628 --> 01:16:27,629
- I...
- Ember.

1217
01:16:27,921 --> 01:16:29,381
- Silence!
- No!

1218
01:16:29,464 --> 01:16:30,799
Take the chance.

1219
01:16:30,883 --> 01:16:32,801
Let your father know
who you really are.

1220
01:16:34,761 --> 01:16:37,639
Look, I had regrets
when my dad died.

1221
01:16:37,723 --> 01:16:38,932
But because of you, I learned

1222
01:16:39,016 --> 01:16:41,768
to embrace the light
while it burns.

1223
01:16:42,144 --> 01:16:43,353
<i>Tìshók.</i>

1224
01:16:43,896 --> 01:16:46,940
You don't have forever
to say what you need to say.

1225
01:16:47,608 --> 01:16:49,484
I love you, Ember Lumen.

1226
01:16:53,071 --> 01:16:55,157
And I'm pretty sure
you love me too.

1227
01:16:58,660 --> 01:17:01,288
No, Wade, I don't.

1228
01:17:04,333 --> 01:17:06,835
That's not true.
I did their reading.

1229
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:09,254
Bernie, it's love.

1230
01:17:09,338 --> 01:17:10,589
It's true love.

1231
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,634
No, Mom, you're wrong.
Wade, go.

1232
01:17:13,717 --> 01:17:14,718
But, Ember...

1233
01:17:14,801 --> 01:17:16,512
I don't love you.

1234
01:17:18,639 --> 01:17:20,307
Go!

1235
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:37,115
You have been seeing Water?

1236
01:17:37,199 --> 01:17:38,408
<i>Àshfá</i>, I...

1237
01:17:38,492 --> 01:17:40,285
You caused leak in shop?

1238
01:17:41,537 --> 01:17:43,455
I trusted you.

1239
01:17:44,164 --> 01:17:46,959
You will not take over the shop.

1240
01:17:49,044 --> 01:17:51,338
I no longer retire.

1241
01:18:40,012 --> 01:18:43,140
Why can't I just
be a good daughter?

1242
01:19:19,176 --> 01:19:20,260
Firetown.

1243
01:19:23,430 --> 01:19:26,308
Well, one-way ticket
to anywhere but here.

1244
01:19:26,391 --> 01:19:28,227
Go. Travel the world.

1245
01:19:28,310 --> 01:19:30,312
Heal that broken heart.

1246
01:19:30,395 --> 01:19:33,524
My little drip, drip baby boy.

1247
01:19:34,691 --> 01:19:38,278
<i>Drip, drip, drip, goes the baby boy</i>

1248
01:19:39,530 --> 01:19:41,240
I made you a painting.

1249
01:19:41,323 --> 01:19:43,534
It's of a lonely man

1250
01:19:43,617 --> 01:19:45,327
awash in sadness.

1251
01:19:51,667 --> 01:19:52,751
Ember.

1252
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:02,052
Mom, Dad!

1253
01:20:20,946 --> 01:20:22,197
Water's coming!

1254
01:20:22,281 --> 01:20:24,324
Watch out!

1255
01:20:24,408 --> 01:20:25,409
Behind you!

1256
01:20:26,326 --> 01:20:27,646
Climb! Climb!

1257
01:20:27,911 --> 01:20:29,621
Flash flood! Hurry!

1258
01:20:30,205 --> 01:20:31,498
Mom, water!

1259
01:20:31,582 --> 01:20:32,782
Get to higher ground!

1260
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,585
- Bernie!
- Huh?

1261
01:20:47,764 --> 01:20:49,516
The flame!

1262
01:20:49,600 --> 01:20:50,642
Let me go!

1263
01:20:54,188 --> 01:20:55,189
Ember, no!

1264
01:21:14,958 --> 01:21:16,752
- Wade?
- Keyhole.

1265
01:21:22,466 --> 01:21:24,510
I was hoping to make
a more heroic entrance.

1266
01:21:24,593 --> 01:21:27,221
You came back,
after everything I said.

1267
01:21:27,304 --> 01:21:28,972
Are you kidding?
And miss all this?

1268
01:21:32,434 --> 01:21:34,520
Hold the door.

1269
01:21:47,199 --> 01:21:49,660
No! No.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

1270
01:21:55,666 --> 01:21:57,334
Ember, we have to go!

1271
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:59,169
We have to go now!

1272
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:00,629
I can't leave.

1273
01:22:00,712 --> 01:22:03,131
I'm sorry to say this,
but the shop is done.

1274
01:22:03,215 --> 01:22:04,299
The flame is done.

1275
01:22:04,383 --> 01:22:06,760
No! This is
my father's whole life.

1276
01:22:06,844 --> 01:22:08,136
I'm not going anywhere.

1277
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:15,561
Throw me that lantern.

1278
01:22:25,737 --> 01:22:26,864
No.

1279
01:22:29,616 --> 01:22:31,076
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1280
01:22:32,828 --> 01:22:34,079
Oh, Wade.

1281
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:35,706
Thank you, thank you.

1282
01:22:37,207 --> 01:22:38,792
Aah!

1283
01:22:59,605 --> 01:23:00,772
It's too hot in here.

1284
01:23:03,275 --> 01:23:04,276
Climb!

1285
01:23:13,035 --> 01:23:14,828
Back up! Back up!

1286
01:23:28,550 --> 01:23:29,861
- I have to open that up.
- No!

1287
01:23:29,885 --> 01:23:32,346
The water will come in
and you'll be snuffed out.

1288
01:23:32,429 --> 01:23:35,432
But you're evaporating.
I don't know what to do.

1289
01:23:35,682 --> 01:23:36,683
It's okay.

1290
01:23:36,767 --> 01:23:38,477
No, it's not okay!

1291
01:23:47,444 --> 01:23:48,445
Ember,

1292
01:23:48,862 --> 01:23:50,405
I have no regrets.

1293
01:23:50,489 --> 01:23:51,490
You gave me something

1294
01:23:51,573 --> 01:23:53,116
people search for
their whole lives.

1295
01:23:53,450 --> 01:23:56,203
But I can't exist
in a world without you.

1296
01:23:56,912 --> 01:23:59,998
I'm sorry
I didn't say it before.

1297
01:24:01,542 --> 01:24:03,043
I love you, Wade.

1298
01:24:10,634 --> 01:24:13,762
I really do love it
when your light does that.

1299
01:24:31,321 --> 01:24:32,590
They're in the hearth!

1300
01:24:41,540 --> 01:24:42,749
Wade is gone.

1301
01:24:43,667 --> 01:24:45,169
Oh, my daughter.

1302
01:24:46,211 --> 01:24:47,713
He saved me.

1303
01:25:01,727 --> 01:25:02,853
Dad...

1304
01:25:04,188 --> 01:25:07,399
this is all my fault.

1305
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:08,817
The shop...

1306
01:25:10,819 --> 01:25:11,987
Wade.

1307
01:25:15,991 --> 01:25:18,368
I need to tell you the truth.

1308
01:25:19,244 --> 01:25:21,330
I don't want to run the shop.

1309
01:25:22,539 --> 01:25:26,293
I know that was your dream,
but it's not mine.

1310
01:25:27,336 --> 01:25:28,921
I'm sorry.

1311
01:25:30,088 --> 01:25:31,798
I'm a bad daughter.

1312
01:25:41,517 --> 01:25:42,684
Ember,

1313
01:25:43,060 --> 01:25:45,604
the shop was never the dream.

1314
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:47,648
You were the dream.

1315
01:25:48,148 --> 01:25:50,609
You were always the dream.

1316
01:25:58,492 --> 01:26:00,369
I loved him, Dad.

1317
01:26:32,234 --> 01:26:33,652
Butterfly.

1318
01:26:36,321 --> 01:26:40,492
Butterfly. Windshield wipers.
Half a butterfly.

1319
01:26:48,000 --> 01:26:49,668
An old man on his deathbed

1320
01:26:49,751 --> 01:26:51,879
remembers the summer
he fell in love.

1321
01:26:58,594 --> 01:27:00,512
She was out of his league

1322
01:27:00,596 --> 01:27:03,473
and he was young and scared.

1323
01:27:03,557 --> 01:27:06,935
He let her go, thinking surely
summer would come again.

1324
01:27:07,477 --> 01:27:08,687
It never did.

1325
01:27:12,983 --> 01:27:15,736
You are perfect match.
Ten out of ten.

1326
01:27:18,572 --> 01:27:20,365
I don't understand.
What's going on?

1327
01:27:20,449 --> 01:27:23,160
Just say something
to make Water guy cry, okay?

1328
01:27:23,243 --> 01:27:25,454
Um... Uh...

1329
01:27:25,537 --> 01:27:27,372
You are no longer panned.

1330
01:27:28,081 --> 01:27:30,083
- Banned.
- Banned.

1331
01:27:32,294 --> 01:27:35,672
I want to explore the world
with you, Wade Ripple.

1332
01:27:35,756 --> 01:27:38,300
I want to have you
with me in my life.

1333
01:27:38,383 --> 01:27:39,426
Forever.

1334
01:27:51,897 --> 01:27:53,941
Whoa!

1335
01:27:54,483 --> 01:27:57,402
Your, uh, chimney
needs cleaning.

1336
01:28:20,342 --> 01:28:24,012
I knew it.
My nose always knows.

1337
01:28:37,901 --> 01:28:41,321
If you were a vegetable,
you'd be a cute-cumber.

1338
01:28:42,489 --> 01:28:44,032
My queen.

1339
01:28:45,200 --> 01:28:48,662
Ah! I can't believe I was
gonna shut this place down.

1340
01:28:48,745 --> 01:28:50,706
Whoa. Sorry.

1341
01:28:50,789 --> 01:28:54,209
Fern, you're a Windbreakers fan?

1342
01:28:54,543 --> 01:28:55,627
Toot toot.

1343
01:28:56,086 --> 01:28:58,213
Toot toot.

1344
01:28:58,297 --> 01:29:01,175
Oy, you know what I like best
about running this shop?

1345
01:29:01,258 --> 01:29:03,719
Not having to eat
Bernie's kol-nuts?

1346
01:29:04,970 --> 01:29:08,891
Sorry, I couldn't hear you
through my retirement.

1347
01:29:23,780 --> 01:29:25,782
Ooh!

1348
01:29:34,666 --> 01:29:36,084
Hey!

1349
01:29:36,460 --> 01:29:38,003
- Hi, Wade.
- Hey, Wade! Yo, yo, yo!

1350
01:29:39,379 --> 01:29:41,548
Ember, it's time.

1351
01:29:46,720 --> 01:29:48,764
You know, I...
I'm not really one

1352
01:29:48,847 --> 01:29:49,973
for tearful goodbyes.

1353
01:29:50,057 --> 01:29:51,642
Oh, Wade.

1354
01:29:52,226 --> 01:29:55,187
You big liar.

1355
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:57,397
<i>Drip, drip, drip</i>

1356
01:29:57,481 --> 01:29:59,775
<i>Goes the baby boy</i>

1357
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:06,573
Uh, are you sure about this one?

1358
01:30:06,657 --> 01:30:07,741
I'm sure.

1359
01:30:08,450 --> 01:30:09,451
Dad,

1360
01:30:09,826 --> 01:30:12,329
I'm sorry the internship
is so far away.

1361
01:30:12,871 --> 01:30:15,058
I mean, it's the best glass
design company in the world,

1362
01:30:15,082 --> 01:30:16,834
but who knows
if it'll become a real job.

1363
01:30:16,917 --> 01:30:18,186
I'll be back
in a few months anyway,

1364
01:30:18,210 --> 01:30:19,878
and it might not
end up being anything...

1365
01:30:19,962 --> 01:30:22,339
Ay-yah. Shh.
Go, start new life.

1366
01:30:22,422 --> 01:30:24,466
Your mother and I will be here.

1367
01:30:24,550 --> 01:30:26,927
Now, with more time
for hanky-panky.

1368
01:30:27,010 --> 01:30:28,345
<i>Ê shútsh!</i>

1369
01:31:49,426 --> 01:31:52,054
<i>Started out on a one-way train</i>

1370
01:31:52,137 --> 01:31:54,681
<i>Always knew where
I was gonna go next</i>

1371
01:31:54,765 --> 01:31:57,267
<i>Didn't know until I saw your face</i>

1372
01:31:57,351 --> 01:31:59,853
<i>I was missing out on every moment</i>

1373
01:31:59,937 --> 01:32:02,439
<i>You'll be one and, baby, I'll be two</i>

1374
01:32:02,523 --> 01:32:05,234
<i>Would you mind it if I said I'm into you?</i>

1375
01:32:06,485 --> 01:32:07,903
<i>I'm into you</i>

1376
01:32:09,196 --> 01:32:12,199
<i>So if it's real</i>

1377
01:32:12,282 --> 01:32:15,536
<i>Then, darlin', let me know</i>

1378
01:32:19,540 --> 01:32:22,835
<i>I wouldn't mind</i>

1379
01:32:22,918 --> 01:32:25,879
<i>If you steal the show</i>

1380
01:32:46,608 --> 01:32:49,111
<i>You and I, we go together</i>

1381
01:32:49,194 --> 01:32:51,613
<i>You're the sky
I'll be the weather</i>

1382
01:32:51,697 --> 01:32:54,616
<i>A pretty thing, the sun
and rain, who knew?</i>

1383
01:32:55,284 --> 01:32:56,869
<i>Oh-oh-oh, yeah</i>

1384
01:32:56,952 --> 01:32:59,580
<i>Summer night, perfect occasion</i>

1385
01:32:59,663 --> 01:33:03,000
<i>Where am I?
You know I'll be waitin' for you</i>

1386
01:33:04,459 --> 01:33:06,211
<i>Oh, for you</i>

1387
01:33:06,295 --> 01:33:09,047
<i>So if it's real</i>

1388
01:33:09,381 --> 01:33:12,718
<i>Then, darlin', let me know</i>

1389
01:33:16,722 --> 01:33:19,975

<i>If you steal the show</i>

1395
01:33:43,290 --> 01:33:45,501
<i>You shine</i>

1396
01:33:45,584 --> 01:33:47,961
<i>You shine</i>

1397
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:49,463
<i>Like forever</i>

1398
01:33:50,589 --> 01:33:51,840
<i>Lasts forever</i>

1399
01:33:53,550 --> 01:33:56,094
<i>You shine</i>

1400
01:33:56,178 --> 01:33:59,389
<i>You shine and steal the show</i>

1401
01:34:03,268 --> 01:34:06,104
<i>So if it's real</i>

1402
01:34:06,188 --> 01:34:09,733
