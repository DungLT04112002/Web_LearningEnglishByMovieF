1
00:00:00,842 --> 00:00:30,262

2
00:00:37,882 --> 00:00:41,318
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

3
00:00:41,385 --> 00:00:44,548
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

4
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:50,252
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

5
00:01:00,104 --> 00:01:05,804
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

6
00:01:05,876 --> 00:01:09,403
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

7
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:12,643
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

8
00:01:12,717 --> 00:01:15,015
Enough talk. Let's fight!

9
00:01:15,086 --> 00:01:16,519
Shashabooey!

10
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,321
He was so deadly in fact,

11
00:01:21,392 --> 00:01:25,089
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

12
00:01:25,162 --> 00:01:27,357
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

13
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,195
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

14
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:33,435
There is no charge for awesomeness.

15
00:01:33,504 --> 00:01:36,132
Or attractiveness.

16
00:01:36,207 --> 00:01:37,469
Kablooey!

17
00:01:37,541 --> 00:01:40,271
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

18
00:01:40,344 --> 00:01:43,211
They were no match for his bodacity!

19
00:01:55,726 --> 00:02:00,390
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

20
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,961
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

21
00:02:04,035 --> 00:02:06,265
the Furious Five,

22
00:02:06,337 --> 00:02:09,272
bowed in respect
to this great master.

23
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,171
We should hang out.

24
00:02:11,242 --> 00:02:12,368
Agreed.

25
00:02:15,212 --> 00:02:17,373
But hanging out would have to wait.

26
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:21,885
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

27
00:02:21,952 --> 00:02:24,750
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

28
00:02:24,989 --> 00:02:26,581
Po! Get up!

29
00:02:26,657 --> 00:02:28,420
You'll be later for work!

30
00:02:28,492 --> 00:02:29,754
What?

31
00:02:36,267 --> 00:02:38,531
Po! Get up!

32
00:02:53,884 --> 00:02:57,342
Po. What are you doing up there?

33
00:02:57,421 --> 00:02:58,683
Nothing.

34
00:03:02,226 --> 00:03:05,957
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

35
00:03:12,436 --> 00:03:15,701
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

36
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:17,138
Coming!

37
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:28,677
Sorry, Dad.

38
00:03:28,753 --> 00:03:31,586
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

39
00:03:31,655 --> 00:03:34,021
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

40
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,582
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

41
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:37,888
About what?

42
00:03:37,962 --> 00:03:39,554
What were you dreaming about?

43
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:41,154
What was I?

44
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:43,990
I was dreaming about...

45
00:03:46,036 --> 00:03:47,025
...noodles.

46
00:03:47,505 --> 00:03:51,168
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

47
00:03:51,242 --> 00:03:53,802
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

48
00:03:53,878 --> 00:03:56,346
Careful! That soup is sharp.

49
00:03:56,414 --> 00:03:57,881
Oh, happy day!

50
00:03:57,948 --> 00:04:01,850
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

51
00:04:03,254 --> 00:04:07,247
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

52
00:04:07,324 --> 00:04:09,189
This is a sign, Po.

53
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:11,057
A sign of what?

54
00:04:11,128 --> 00:04:15,758
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

55
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:18,097
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

56
00:04:18,169 --> 00:04:23,300
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

57
00:04:23,374 --> 00:04:26,866
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

58
00:04:26,944 --> 00:04:29,606
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

59
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,376
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

60
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:34,748
No, it was the dream.

61
00:04:34,819 --> 00:04:38,380
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

62
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:42,358
But, Dad, didn't you ever want
to do something else?

63
00:04:42,426 --> 00:04:44,291
Something besides noodles?

64
00:04:44,361 --> 00:04:47,296
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

65
00:04:47,364 --> 00:04:51,425
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

66
00:04:51,502 --> 00:04:52,628
Why didn't you?

67
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:54,466
Because it was a stupid dream.

68
00:04:55,239 --> 00:04:58,675
Can you imagine me making tofu?

69
00:04:59,477 --> 00:05:01,172
Tofu.

70
00:05:01,245 --> 00:05:04,646
No! We all have our place in this world.

71
00:05:04,715 --> 00:05:07,275
Mine is here, and yours is...

72
00:05:07,351 --> 00:05:08,579
I know, is here.

73
00:05:08,652 --> 00:05:11,780
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12

74
00:05:11,856 --> 00:05:13,915
Service with a smile.

75
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:47,520
Well done, students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

76
00:05:47,591 --> 00:05:50,754
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

77
00:05:50,828 --> 00:05:53,729
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

78
00:05:53,797 --> 00:05:55,628
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

79
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,133
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

80
00:06:09,046 --> 00:06:12,482
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

81
00:06:18,822 --> 00:06:23,259
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

82
00:06:23,327 --> 00:06:25,454
So, nothing's wrong?

83
00:06:25,529 --> 00:06:28,157
Well, I didn't say that.

84
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:47,879
You were saying?

85
00:06:47,985 --> 00:06:51,045
I have had a vision.

86
00:06:51,121 --> 00:06:53,851
Tai Lung will return.

87
00:06:58,796 --> 00:07:01,356
That is impossible! He is in prison.

88
00:07:01,432 --> 00:07:04,196
Nothing is impossible.

89
00:07:05,069 --> 00:07:06,058
Zeng!

90
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:08,468
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

91
00:07:08,539 --> 00:07:11,872
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

92
00:07:11,942 --> 00:07:13,842
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

93
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:15,378
Yes, Master Shifu!

94
00:07:17,214 --> 00:07:22,379
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

95
00:07:22,453 --> 00:07:26,446
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

96
00:07:26,523 --> 00:07:27,512
He'll...

97
00:07:27,591 --> 00:07:29,889
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:33,396
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

99
00:07:34,298 --> 00:07:36,562
But if you allow it to settle...

100
00:07:36,967 --> 00:07:39,629
...the answer becomes clear.

101
00:07:42,973 --> 00:07:44,736
The Dragon Scroll.

102
00:07:45,609 --> 00:07:47,167
It is time.

103
00:07:47,244 --> 00:07:51,977
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

104
00:07:52,049 --> 00:07:56,782
To become the Dragon Warrior?

105
00:07:56,854 --> 00:07:58,321
I don't know.

106
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:02,083
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

107
00:08:02,993 --> 00:08:04,017
Watch it!

108
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:05,584
Sorry. Suck it up!

109
00:08:07,031 --> 00:08:09,761
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

110
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:10,822
What?

111
00:08:12,936 --> 00:08:16,201
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

112
00:08:16,273 --> 00:08:20,869
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

113
00:08:20,944 --> 00:08:24,004
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

114
00:08:24,081 --> 00:08:28,211
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

115
00:08:28,285 --> 00:08:30,276
Po! Where are you going?

116
00:08:31,188 --> 00:08:33,520
To the Jade Palace.

117
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,888
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

118
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,521
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

119
00:08:40,597 --> 00:08:41,996
Selling noodles?

120
00:08:44,702 --> 00:08:47,102
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

121
00:08:47,171 --> 00:08:49,298
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

122
00:08:53,143 --> 00:08:57,705
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

123
00:08:57,781 --> 00:08:59,476
That's my boy!

124
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,813
I told you that dream was a sign.

125
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:04,821
Yeah. Glad I had it.

126
00:09:09,026 --> 00:09:11,426
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

127
00:09:11,495 --> 00:09:14,020
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

128
00:09:48,532 --> 00:09:51,296
Come on. Come on!

129
00:09:51,368 --> 00:09:53,233
Almost there.

130
00:09:53,303 --> 00:09:54,463
What?

131
00:09:54,538 --> 00:09:57,200
No! Oh, no!

132
00:09:59,543 --> 00:10:03,104
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

133
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:11,043
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

134
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,659
It is an historic day.

135
00:10:17,728 --> 00:10:19,491
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

136
00:10:19,563 --> 00:10:24,432
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

137
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:26,492
Are your students ready?

138
00:10:26,570 --> 00:10:28,333
Yes, Master Oogway.

139
00:10:29,506 --> 00:10:31,235
Know this, old friend.

140
00:10:31,308 --> 00:10:35,642
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

141
00:10:35,712 --> 00:10:38,340
...but also to you.

142
00:10:42,052 --> 00:10:42,152
Let the tournament begin!

143
00:10:42,152 --> 00:10:45,815
Let the tournament begin!

144
00:10:57,267 --> 00:10:58,632
Yeah.

145
00:11:01,138 --> 00:11:02,366
No, no, wait!

146
00:11:02,439 --> 00:11:04,771
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

147
00:11:04,842 --> 00:11:06,070
Yes!

148
00:11:09,079 --> 00:11:11,445
Hey! Open the door!

149
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,444
Let me in!

150
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,080
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

151
00:11:19,156 --> 00:11:22,853
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

152
00:11:22,926 --> 00:11:27,090
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

153
00:11:27,164 --> 00:11:28,495
The Furious Five!

154
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:42,745
Yeah, the Furious Five!

155
00:11:45,048 --> 00:11:46,379
Warriors, prepare!

156
00:11:46,450 --> 00:11:49,010
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

157
00:11:49,086 --> 00:11:50,417
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

158
00:11:52,489 --> 00:11:54,480
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

159
00:11:56,793 --> 00:11:57,919
Look at that.

160
00:11:57,995 --> 00:11:59,986
Hey! Get out of the way!

161
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,531
And finally Master Tigress!

162
00:12:37,968 --> 00:12:42,371
And believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

163
00:12:42,439 --> 00:12:43,701
I know!

164
00:12:43,774 --> 00:12:48,871
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

165
00:13:01,291 --> 00:13:05,728
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

166
00:13:10,867 --> 00:13:13,893
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

167
00:13:13,971 --> 00:13:18,499
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

168
00:13:19,476 --> 00:13:21,637
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

169
00:13:22,913 --> 00:13:24,403
Yeah.

170
00:13:40,931 --> 00:13:41,955
Po!

171
00:13:42,032 --> 00:13:43,966
What are you doing?!

172
00:13:44,034 --> 00:13:46,594
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

173
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,604
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

174
00:13:51,908 --> 00:13:56,038
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

175
00:13:56,913 --> 00:13:59,939
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

176
00:14:02,753 --> 00:14:06,280
I love kung fu!

177
00:14:18,435 --> 00:14:23,304
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

178
00:14:25,909 --> 00:14:27,308
OK.

179
00:14:33,383 --> 00:14:35,146
Come back!

180
00:14:59,376 --> 00:15:01,173
What's going on?

181
00:15:01,945 --> 00:15:03,606
Where?

182
00:15:06,116 --> 00:15:07,674
What are you pointing?

183
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:12,411
OK. Sorry.

184
00:15:12,489 --> 00:15:14,957
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

185
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:16,959
How interesting.

186
00:15:17,027 --> 00:15:20,326
Master, are you pointing at me?

187
00:15:20,397 --> 00:15:22,422
- Him.
- Who?

188
00:15:24,468 --> 00:15:26,629
- You.
- Me?

189
00:15:26,703 --> 00:15:32,198
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

190
00:15:32,442 --> 00:15:33,875
- What?
- What?!

191
00:15:33,944 --> 00:15:35,639
- What?!
- What?!

192
00:15:45,522 --> 00:15:48,116
Stop, wait! Who told you to?

193
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:59,130
Master Oogway, wait.

194
00:15:59,236 --> 00:16:03,468
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

195
00:16:03,507 --> 00:16:07,238
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

196
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,743
That was just an accident!

197
00:16:08,812 --> 00:16:11,576
There are no accidents.

198
00:16:26,696 --> 00:16:29,460
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

199
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:32,866
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

200
00:16:32,936 --> 00:16:35,268
then I will have failed you.

201
00:16:53,557 --> 00:16:56,287
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

202
00:16:56,359 --> 00:16:58,623
...from Master Shifu.

203
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:04,458
What?!

204
00:17:04,534 --> 00:17:05,865
"Double the guard?!"

205
00:17:05,936 --> 00:17:07,733
"Extra precautions?!"

206
00:17:07,804 --> 00:17:10,136
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

207
00:17:13,243 --> 00:17:16,701
You doubt my prison security?!

208
00:17:16,780 --> 00:17:18,645
Absolutely not.

209
00:17:18,715 --> 00:17:21,843
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

210
00:17:21,918 --> 00:17:25,547
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

211
00:17:26,189 --> 00:17:29,317
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

212
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:36,498
Impressive, isn't it?

213
00:17:37,467 --> 00:17:39,264
It's very impressive.

214
00:17:39,336 --> 00:17:40,826
It's very impressive.

215
00:17:40,904 --> 00:17:43,566
One way in, one way out.

216
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:47,736
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

217
00:17:47,811 --> 00:17:50,336
Yes, except that prisoner...

218
00:17:50,413 --> 00:17:52,108
...is Tai Lung.

219
00:17:56,186 --> 00:17:57,915
Take us down.

220
00:18:03,426 --> 00:18:04,791
What are you doing?

221
00:18:16,139 --> 00:18:17,606
Oh, my.

222
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,938
Behold Tai Lung.

223
00:18:26,616 --> 00:18:29,676
I'm just gonna wait right here.

224
00:18:29,753 --> 00:18:34,053
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

225
00:18:34,124 --> 00:18:36,388
Crossbows! At the ready!

226
00:18:36,459 --> 00:18:38,256
Crossbows?

227
00:18:38,328 --> 00:18:40,888
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

228
00:18:40,964 --> 00:18:45,458
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

229
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:47,196
Don't get him mad.

230
00:18:47,270 --> 00:18:52,071
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

231
00:18:56,313 --> 00:19:00,272
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

232
00:19:00,383 --> 00:19:02,180
I'm good. I've seen enough.

233
00:19:02,218 --> 00:19:04,652
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

234
00:19:04,721 --> 00:19:05,949
No, he doesn't.

235
00:19:06,022 --> 00:19:08,252
I'll tell him that.

236
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:10,190
Can we please go now?

237
00:19:25,775 --> 00:19:28,678
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

238
00:19:28,678 --> 00:19:29,201
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

239
00:19:34,918 --> 00:19:36,351
Wait a second!

240
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:46,022
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

241
00:19:48,965 --> 00:19:52,298
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

242
00:19:53,269 --> 00:19:54,702
Look at this place.

243
00:19:56,873 --> 00:20:01,310
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

244
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:05,241
The Sword of Heroes!

245
00:20:05,315 --> 00:20:08,580
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

246
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,316
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

247
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:18,155
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

248
00:20:24,434 --> 00:20:25,992
No!

249
00:20:27,337 --> 00:20:30,101
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

250
00:20:30,173 --> 00:20:33,336
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

251
00:20:36,713 --> 00:20:37,839
Hello.

252
00:20:37,914 --> 00:20:40,246
Have you finished sight-seeing?

253
00:20:40,316 --> 00:20:42,409
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

254
00:20:42,485 --> 00:20:44,453
My patience is wearing thin.

255
00:20:44,521 --> 00:20:47,354
Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

256
00:20:47,424 --> 00:20:49,790
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

257
00:20:49,859 --> 00:20:50,883
How's it going?

258
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,394
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

259
00:20:55,999 --> 00:20:57,762
Someone... broke that.

260
00:20:57,834 --> 00:21:00,200
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

261
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:02,365
...glue?

262
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:06,364
A splinter.

263
00:21:06,443 --> 00:21:09,435
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

264
00:21:09,512 --> 00:21:12,640
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

265
00:21:12,715 --> 00:21:16,446
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

266
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,454
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

267
00:21:21,658 --> 00:21:24,092
So, how does this work?

268
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:27,061
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

269
00:21:28,398 --> 00:21:32,425
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

270
00:21:32,502 --> 00:21:34,402
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

271
00:21:34,471 --> 00:21:37,497
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

272
00:21:37,574 --> 00:21:41,635
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

273
00:21:41,711 --> 00:21:42,735
Someone like me?

274
00:21:42,812 --> 00:21:47,476
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

275
00:21:47,550 --> 00:21:50,018
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

276
00:21:50,086 --> 00:21:52,919
And this ridiculous belly.

277
00:21:52,989 --> 00:21:56,254
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

278
00:21:56,326 --> 00:21:58,487
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

279
00:21:58,561 --> 00:22:01,086
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

280
00:22:01,197 --> 00:22:03,062
Listen, Oogway said I was...

281
00:22:03,099 --> 00:22:05,795
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

282
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:08,599
Oh, you know this hold?

283
00:22:08,671 --> 00:22:11,333
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

284
00:22:11,407 --> 00:22:14,171
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

285
00:22:15,044 --> 00:22:17,706
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

286
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:21,648
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

287
00:22:21,718 --> 00:22:23,845
OK, OK, take it easy.

288
00:22:23,920 --> 00:22:26,354
Now listen closely, panda.

289
00:22:26,422 --> 00:22:29,550
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

290
00:22:29,626 --> 00:22:34,529
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

291
00:22:34,697 --> 00:22:37,825
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

292
00:22:37,901 --> 00:22:39,630
Good.

293
00:22:39,702 --> 00:22:41,636
I can't wait to get started.

294
00:23:21,244 --> 00:23:23,508
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

295
00:23:23,813 --> 00:23:25,110
What?

296
00:23:26,683 --> 00:23:29,151
- Now?
- Yes, now.

297
00:23:29,218 --> 00:23:33,518
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

298
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,148
Oh, OK, well...

299
00:23:35,224 --> 00:23:39,217
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

300
00:23:39,295 --> 00:23:42,059
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

301
00:23:42,131 --> 00:23:45,965
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

302
00:23:46,035 --> 00:23:47,093
What level is that?

303
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:50,628
Well, I'm not a master, but...

304
00:23:50,707 --> 00:23:53,471
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

305
00:23:53,543 --> 00:23:57,639
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

306
00:23:57,714 --> 00:24:00,478
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

307
00:24:00,583 --> 00:24:05,646
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

308
00:24:05,688 --> 00:24:07,053
But if you insist...

309
00:24:07,123 --> 00:24:09,887
The Furious Five!

310
00:24:09,959 --> 00:24:14,225
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

311
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,060
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

312
00:24:21,938 --> 00:24:25,305
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work?

313
00:24:25,375 --> 00:24:26,364
Hit it.

314
00:24:26,476 --> 00:24:31,106
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

315
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:34,946
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

316
00:24:35,018 --> 00:24:36,144
Just hit it.

317
00:24:36,986 --> 00:24:38,112
All right.

318
00:24:39,088 --> 00:24:42,489
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

319
00:24:42,558 --> 00:24:45,584
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

320
00:24:45,662 --> 00:24:47,857
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

321
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,922
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

322
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,797
You've only seen praying mantis.

323
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,803
Or monkey style.

324
00:24:55,471 --> 00:24:57,803
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

325
00:24:57,874 --> 00:25:00,240
Would you hit it!

326
00:25:00,343 --> 00:25:02,470
All right. All right.

327
00:25:08,184 --> 00:25:11,278
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

328
00:25:13,022 --> 00:25:14,284
How's that?

329
00:25:25,068 --> 00:25:26,558
That hurts.

330
00:25:33,576 --> 00:25:35,737
This will be easier than I thought.

331
00:25:35,812 --> 00:25:38,303
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

332
00:25:39,148 --> 00:25:40,445
Those are hard!

333
00:25:44,821 --> 00:25:46,254
My tenders.

334
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:16,045
How did I do?

335
00:26:16,119 --> 00:26:19,919
There is now a level zero.

336
00:26:19,989 --> 00:26:20,089
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

337
00:26:20,089 --> 00:26:22,387
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

338
00:26:22,458 --> 00:26:24,790
What was Master Oogway thinking?

339
00:26:24,861 --> 00:26:27,159
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

340
00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:29,721
He is so mighty!

341
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:34,634
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

342
00:26:34,704 --> 00:26:37,537
When he walks, the very ground shakes!

343
00:26:38,541 --> 00:26:42,807
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

344
00:26:42,879 --> 00:26:44,904
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

345
00:26:44,981 --> 00:26:47,381
Or even see his toes.

346
00:27:11,741 --> 00:27:12,901
OK.

347
00:27:21,717 --> 00:27:23,344
Great.

348
00:27:38,201 --> 00:27:39,793
Hi. You're up.

349
00:27:39,869 --> 00:27:41,268
I am now.

350
00:27:41,437 --> 00:27:42,836
I was just...

351
00:27:42,905 --> 00:27:44,805
Some day, huh?

352
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:49,277
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

353
00:27:50,313 --> 00:27:55,114
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

354
00:27:55,852 --> 00:27:59,185
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

355
00:27:59,288 --> 00:28:01,722
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

356
00:28:01,757 --> 00:28:04,624
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

357
00:28:04,694 --> 00:28:07,390
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

358
00:28:07,463 --> 00:28:10,955
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

359
00:28:13,736 --> 00:28:16,068
Sorry about that.

360
00:28:16,138 --> 00:28:18,629
Look, you don't belong here.

361
00:28:20,343 --> 00:28:23,244
I know. I know. You're right.

362
00:28:23,312 --> 00:28:25,803
I don't have... I just...

363
00:28:25,882 --> 00:28:27,406
My whole life I dreamed of...

364
00:28:27,483 --> 00:28:32,352
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

365
00:28:33,723 --> 00:28:35,782
Property of Crane.

366
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,723
OK. Right, right.

367
00:28:37,793 --> 00:28:40,318
So, you want to get to sleep.

368
00:28:40,396 --> 00:28:42,193
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

369
00:28:42,265 --> 00:28:44,392
We got big things tomorrow.

370
00:28:44,467 --> 00:28:48,665
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

371
00:28:52,508 --> 00:28:53,668
What was that?

372
00:28:53,743 --> 00:28:55,176
I didn't say anything.

373
00:28:55,244 --> 00:28:57,405
OK. All right. Good night.

374
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,674
Sleep well.

375
00:29:01,484 --> 00:29:03,349
That seemed a little awkward.

376
00:29:05,321 --> 00:29:07,812
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

377
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:10,586
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

378
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,957
This is your room.

379
00:29:12,028 --> 00:29:15,327
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

380
00:29:15,398 --> 00:29:17,764
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

381
00:29:17,833 --> 00:29:21,462
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

382
00:29:21,804 --> 00:29:23,965
you will be gone by morning.

383
00:29:29,412 --> 00:29:31,039
Big fan!

384
00:29:38,454 --> 00:29:42,288
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

385
00:29:44,627 --> 00:29:49,326
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

386
00:29:49,398 --> 00:29:54,335
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

387
00:29:54,403 --> 00:29:58,396
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

388
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:02,075
So why are you so upset?

389
00:30:07,216 --> 00:30:10,743
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

390
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:14,449
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

391
00:30:14,523 --> 00:30:15,615
Probably.

392
00:30:15,691 --> 00:30:19,388
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

393
00:30:19,462 --> 00:30:20,451
Totally.

394
00:30:20,529 --> 00:30:24,590
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

395
00:30:26,736 --> 00:30:28,636
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

396
00:30:28,704 --> 00:30:32,265
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

397
00:30:32,341 --> 00:30:35,276
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

398
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,280
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

399
00:30:43,452 --> 00:30:45,613
Quit, don't quit.

400
00:30:45,688 --> 00:30:49,715
Noodles, don't noodles.

401
00:30:49,792 --> 00:30:54,456
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

402
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:56,395
There's a saying:

403
00:30:56,465 --> 00:30:58,899
Yesterday is history,

404
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:01,435
tomorrow is a mystery,

405
00:31:01,470 --> 00:31:04,598
but today is a gift.

406
00:31:04,673 --> 00:31:07,471
That is why it is called the present.

407
00:31:37,473 --> 00:31:39,839
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

408
00:31:39,909 --> 00:31:42,400
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

409
00:31:51,153 --> 00:31:52,780
Fire crossbows!

410
00:31:52,855 --> 00:31:54,186
Fire!

411
00:31:56,826 --> 00:31:57,850
Fire!

412
00:32:05,501 --> 00:32:08,197
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

413
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:11,103
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

414
00:32:11,173 --> 00:32:12,299
Bring it up!

415
00:32:15,044 --> 00:32:16,534
Wait! Bring it back!

416
00:32:35,331 --> 00:32:39,324
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

417
00:33:47,069 --> 00:33:50,300
We're dead. So very, very dead.

418
00:33:51,006 --> 00:33:53,065
Not yet we're not. Now!

419
00:34:40,756 --> 00:34:43,452
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

420
00:35:04,313 --> 00:35:05,712
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

421
00:35:07,983 --> 00:35:10,816
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

422
00:35:10,886 --> 00:35:12,911
Fly back there and tell them...

423
00:35:12,988 --> 00:35:16,719
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

424
00:35:28,704 --> 00:35:30,228
Good morning, Master!

425
00:35:31,707 --> 00:35:33,334
Panda!

426
00:35:33,409 --> 00:35:34,398
Panda!

427
00:35:34,777 --> 00:35:35,971
Wake up!

428
00:35:39,515 --> 00:35:40,743
He's quit.

429
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:47,814
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

430
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:50,984
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

431
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,688
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

432
00:35:55,197 --> 00:35:56,721
What are you doing here?!

433
00:35:57,666 --> 00:35:59,657
Hi! Good morning, Master!

434
00:35:59,768 --> 00:36:01,633
I thought I'd warm up a little.

435
00:36:03,772 --> 00:36:04,761
You're stuck.

436
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:07,206
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

437
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:11,008
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

438
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,014
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

439
00:36:14,149 --> 00:36:16,617
Maybe on three. One, two...

440
00:36:17,686 --> 00:36:18,880
...three.

441
00:36:20,656 --> 00:36:22,317
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

442
00:36:22,391 --> 00:36:25,326
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

443
00:36:25,394 --> 00:36:29,694
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

444
00:36:29,765 --> 00:36:33,132
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

445
00:36:33,202 --> 00:36:36,968
And years longer to apply it in combat!

446
00:36:46,382 --> 00:36:47,906
Put that down!

447
00:36:47,983 --> 00:36:52,477
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

448
00:36:52,554 --> 00:36:55,489
Yeah! Excellent.

449
00:36:56,291 --> 00:36:57,485
Let's get started.

450
00:36:59,795 --> 00:37:01,660
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

451
00:37:03,632 --> 00:37:06,624
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

452
00:37:06,702 --> 00:37:10,001
That was awesome! Let's go again!

453
00:37:36,365 --> 00:37:39,300
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

454
00:37:39,368 --> 00:37:41,700
Your next opponent will be me.

455
00:37:41,770 --> 00:37:43,533
All right! Yeah, let's go!

456
00:37:46,041 --> 00:37:48,100
Step forth.

457
00:37:48,177 --> 00:37:51,635
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

458
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,578
...and make him suffer for it.

459
00:37:53,649 --> 00:37:54,980
Oh, yeah!

460
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,417
To take his strength
and use it against him...

461
00:37:58,487 --> 00:38:00,978
...until he finally falls...

462
00:38:01,089 --> 00:38:02,078
...or quits.

463
00:38:02,124 --> 00:38:04,115
A real warrior never quits.

464
00:38:04,193 --> 00:38:07,390
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

465
00:38:17,773 --> 00:38:20,970
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

466
00:38:21,043 --> 00:38:22,374
But he will.

467
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:24,742
He's not going to quit, is he?

468
00:38:24,813 --> 00:38:27,577
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

469
00:38:39,461 --> 00:38:42,521
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

470
00:38:42,598 --> 00:38:43,622
Trust me, it will.

471
00:38:43,699 --> 00:38:47,328
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

472
00:38:47,402 --> 00:38:50,064
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

473
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:51,127
Sure you were.

474
00:38:51,206 --> 00:38:55,267
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

475
00:38:56,445 --> 00:38:57,434
I'm over here.

476
00:38:58,547 --> 00:39:00,981
Maybe you should look at this again.

477
00:39:01,083 --> 00:39:03,483
Oh, OK.

478
00:39:06,288 --> 00:39:08,279
Stop it. Stop!

479
00:39:09,458 --> 00:39:12,393
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

480
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:16,391
...but if I didn't know better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

481
00:39:21,336 --> 00:39:23,736
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

482
00:39:24,373 --> 00:39:26,341
...but he wasn't always like that.

483
00:39:26,408 --> 00:39:27,739
According to legend,

484
00:39:27,809 --> 00:39:32,337
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

485
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:34,348
- No!
- Yes.

486
00:39:34,416 --> 00:39:35,678
But that was before.

487
00:39:35,751 --> 00:39:37,742
Before what?

488
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:39,150
Before Tai Lung.

489
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:41,814
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

490
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:44,882
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

491
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,894
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

492
00:39:46,962 --> 00:39:52,423
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

493
00:39:52,501 --> 00:39:56,665
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

494
00:39:56,738 --> 00:39:58,865
He wasn't just a student.

495
00:40:03,211 --> 00:40:06,044
Shifu found him as a cub...

496
00:40:07,683 --> 00:40:10,618
...and he raised him as his son.

497
00:40:12,988 --> 00:40:16,048
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

498
00:40:17,159 --> 00:40:19,423
...Shifu trained him.

499
00:40:19,494 --> 00:40:23,624
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

500
00:40:25,334 --> 00:40:27,063
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

501
00:40:29,805 --> 00:40:31,397
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

502
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:35,773
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

503
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:39,808
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

504
00:40:42,284 --> 00:40:44,309
He tried to take the scroll by force.

505
00:40:44,386 --> 00:40:48,982
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

506
00:40:50,959 --> 00:40:52,517
But how could he?

507
00:41:06,675 --> 00:41:10,839
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

508
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:20,349
Or since.

509
00:41:28,830 --> 00:41:31,697
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

510
00:41:31,767 --> 00:41:33,997
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

511
00:41:34,069 --> 00:41:37,095
And he's stuck with you.

512
00:41:37,172 --> 00:41:41,040
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

513
00:41:41,943 --> 00:41:42,932
That is it!

514
00:41:43,011 --> 00:41:46,139
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

515
00:41:48,583 --> 00:41:51,051
And may have also stopped his heart.

516
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,281
Inner peace.

517
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:59,550
Inner peace.

518
00:42:02,531 --> 00:42:04,226
Inner...

519
00:42:05,834 --> 00:42:07,734
Inner peace.

520
00:42:10,706 --> 00:42:15,234
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

521
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:19,742
Inner...

522
00:42:24,352 --> 00:42:26,411
Oh, Zeng.

523
00:42:26,488 --> 00:42:28,080
Excellent.

524
00:42:28,156 --> 00:42:30,090
I could use some good news right now.

525
00:42:37,866 --> 00:42:39,231
Master! Master!

526
00:42:39,901 --> 00:42:44,167
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

527
00:42:44,239 --> 00:42:46,605
Shifu.

528
00:42:46,675 --> 00:42:50,076
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

529
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:53,808
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

530
00:42:53,882 --> 00:42:57,283
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

531
00:42:58,754 --> 00:43:01,484
That is bad news...

532
00:43:01,556 --> 00:43:05,890
...if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

533
00:43:05,961 --> 00:43:10,227
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

534
00:43:10,298 --> 00:43:13,597
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

535
00:43:13,668 --> 00:43:15,966
There are no accidents.

536
00:43:17,205 --> 00:43:20,333
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

537
00:43:20,408 --> 00:43:24,606
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

538
00:43:24,679 --> 00:43:25,771
Thrice.

539
00:43:25,847 --> 00:43:27,474
My old friend,

540
00:43:27,549 --> 00:43:32,145
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

541
00:43:32,220 --> 00:43:35,781
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

542
00:43:35,857 --> 00:43:37,222
Illusion?

543
00:43:37,292 --> 00:43:40,284
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

544
00:43:40,362 --> 00:43:43,388
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

545
00:43:43,465 --> 00:43:46,730
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

546
00:43:46,802 --> 00:43:49,327
But there are things we can control.

547
00:43:50,405 --> 00:43:53,499
I can control when the fruit will fall.

548
00:43:54,576 --> 00:43:56,271
And I can control...

549
00:43:57,345 --> 00:43:59,336
...where to plant the seed.

550
00:43:59,848 --> 00:44:01,941
That is no illusion, Master.

551
00:44:03,585 --> 00:44:05,576
Yes.

552
00:44:05,654 --> 00:44:08,054
But no matter what you do

553
00:44:08,123 --> 00:44:11,058
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

554
00:44:11,126 --> 00:44:15,995
You may wish for an apple or an orange,
but you will get a peach.

555
00:44:16,064 --> 00:44:19,693
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

556
00:44:19,768 --> 00:44:22,430
Maybe it can.

557
00:44:22,504 --> 00:44:25,302
If you are willing to guide it.

558
00:44:25,373 --> 00:44:27,238
To nurture it.

559
00:44:27,309 --> 00:44:28,708
To believe in it.

560
00:44:28,777 --> 00:44:31,245
But how? How?

561
00:44:31,313 --> 00:44:33,281
I need your help, Master.

562
00:44:33,348 --> 00:44:37,045
No, you just need to believe.

563
00:44:37,752 --> 00:44:40,050
Promise me, Shifu.

564
00:44:40,655 --> 00:44:43,351
Promise me you will believe.

565
00:44:43,425 --> 00:44:46,986
I will try.

566
00:44:47,829 --> 00:44:49,319
Good.

567
00:44:51,499 --> 00:44:53,558
My time has come.

568
00:44:55,770 --> 00:45:00,139
You must continue
your journey without me.

569
00:45:00,242 --> 00:45:01,937
What are you? Wait!

570
00:45:04,045 --> 00:45:05,342
Master!

571
00:45:06,181 --> 00:45:07,739
You can't leave me!

572
00:45:11,519 --> 00:45:14,147
You must believe.

573
00:45:15,090 --> 00:45:16,682
Master!

574
00:45:47,122 --> 00:45:49,784
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

575
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:52,793
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

576
00:45:53,128 --> 00:45:54,959
...but you're a lousy tipper."

577
00:45:55,030 --> 00:45:57,965
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

578
00:45:58,833 --> 00:46:01,131
I mean, I didn't actually say that...

579
00:46:01,469 --> 00:46:02,936
...but I thought it...

580
00:46:03,004 --> 00:46:04,767
...in my mind.

581
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:07,899
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

582
00:46:08,476 --> 00:46:10,637
Order up! Hope you like it.

583
00:46:12,547 --> 00:46:15,778
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

584
00:46:15,850 --> 00:46:20,150
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

585
00:46:20,221 --> 00:46:22,621
What do you mean? This is amazing!

586
00:46:22,691 --> 00:46:25,626
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

587
00:46:25,694 --> 00:46:27,594
Tigress, you've got to try this.

588
00:46:27,662 --> 00:46:31,291
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

589
00:46:31,366 --> 00:46:36,167
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

590
00:46:37,539 --> 00:46:41,441
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

591
00:46:41,509 --> 00:46:46,503
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

592
00:46:50,919 --> 00:46:54,013
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

593
00:46:56,791 --> 00:47:00,818
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

594
00:47:02,063 --> 00:47:05,499
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

595
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:08,400
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

596
00:47:08,470 --> 00:47:10,370
...you will have ears like mine.

597
00:47:11,973 --> 00:47:13,372
That's good.

598
00:47:13,975 --> 00:47:17,376
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

599
00:47:17,712 --> 00:47:18,838
It's Shifu!

600
00:47:18,913 --> 00:47:21,746
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

601
00:47:23,551 --> 00:47:25,143
Master Shifu!

602
00:47:28,189 --> 00:47:29,884
You think this is funny?

603
00:47:29,958 --> 00:47:32,927
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

604
00:47:32,994 --> 00:47:35,292
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

605
00:47:35,363 --> 00:47:37,729
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

606
00:47:41,403 --> 00:47:44,031
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

607
00:47:44,105 --> 00:47:46,403
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

608
00:47:46,474 --> 00:47:49,307
What? You're serious? And I have to?

609
00:47:51,179 --> 00:47:54,148
Master Oogway will stop him,
like he did before.

610
00:47:54,215 --> 00:47:55,739
Oogway cannot!

611
00:47:56,251 --> 00:47:57,650
Not anymore.

612
00:47:59,154 --> 00:48:01,850
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

613
00:48:01,923 --> 00:48:03,550
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

614
00:48:03,625 --> 00:48:07,220
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

615
00:48:07,295 --> 00:48:10,856
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

616
00:48:10,932 --> 00:48:12,524
It is his!

617
00:48:12,600 --> 00:48:13,726
Where'd he go?

618
00:48:21,076 --> 00:48:24,375
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

619
00:48:24,446 --> 00:48:26,004
Watch me.

620
00:48:28,616 --> 00:48:29,708
Come on.

621
00:48:29,784 --> 00:48:33,618
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

622
00:48:33,688 --> 00:48:36,680
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

623
00:48:37,492 --> 00:48:40,757
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

624
00:48:40,829 --> 00:48:43,821
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

625
00:48:43,898 --> 00:48:46,230
Yes! I was.

626
00:48:46,301 --> 00:48:51,432
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

627
00:48:52,507 --> 00:48:56,238
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

628
00:48:56,311 --> 00:49:00,645
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

629
00:49:00,748 --> 00:49:02,773
Yeah, I stayed.

630
00:49:02,817 --> 00:49:06,583
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

631
00:49:06,654 --> 00:49:11,057
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

632
00:49:11,126 --> 00:49:14,357
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

633
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:19,664
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

634
00:49:20,001 --> 00:49:23,061
...could make me... not me...

635
00:49:23,138 --> 00:49:24,503
...it was you.

636
00:49:24,739 --> 00:49:27,708
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

637
00:49:27,775 --> 00:49:29,367
But I can change you!

638
00:49:29,444 --> 00:49:32,971
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

639
00:49:33,047 --> 00:49:37,040
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

640
00:49:37,118 --> 00:49:40,519
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you...

641
00:49:40,588 --> 00:49:44,854
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

642
00:49:47,162 --> 00:49:48,151
How?

643
00:49:49,797 --> 00:49:50,786
How?

644
00:49:53,835 --> 00:49:56,030
- How?!
- I don't know!

645
00:50:04,078 --> 00:50:05,636
I don't know.

646
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:14,450
That's what I thought.

647
00:50:53,094 --> 00:50:55,255
This is what you trained me for.

648
00:51:02,403 --> 00:51:03,392
Tigress!

649
00:51:07,642 --> 00:51:09,439
Don't try and stop me.

650
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:13,704
We're not trying to stop you.

651
00:51:13,781 --> 00:51:14,770
What?

652
00:51:14,849 --> 00:51:16,714
We're coming with you!

653
00:52:29,891 --> 00:52:33,418
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

654
00:52:34,662 --> 00:52:36,027
No need to explain.

655
00:52:36,097 --> 00:52:40,261
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

656
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:02,884
Don't tell Monkey.

657
00:53:02,957 --> 00:53:06,120
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

658
00:53:06,194 --> 00:53:09,186
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

659
00:53:09,263 --> 00:53:12,027
I don't know. I guess that...

660
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:14,665
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

661
00:53:14,736 --> 00:53:16,636
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

662
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:20,004
And you have done a perfect spilt.

663
00:53:20,074 --> 00:53:23,043
No, this? This is just...

664
00:53:23,778 --> 00:53:25,109
...an accident.

665
00:53:29,350 --> 00:53:32,410
There are no accidents.

666
00:53:32,487 --> 00:53:33,545
Come with me.

667
00:53:41,562 --> 00:53:44,998
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

668
00:53:45,066 --> 00:53:47,796
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

669
00:53:57,712 --> 00:54:00,180
You dragged me...

670
00:54:00,281 --> 00:54:01,976
...all the way out here...

671
00:54:02,016 --> 00:54:03,347
...for a bath?

672
00:54:06,988 --> 00:54:08,319
Panda...

673
00:54:08,389 --> 00:54:12,018
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

674
00:54:13,261 --> 00:54:14,285
The Pool of...

675
00:54:14,362 --> 00:54:16,956
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

676
00:54:17,031 --> 00:54:19,226
...of harmony and focus.

677
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,825
This is the birthplace...

678
00:54:21,903 --> 00:54:23,165
...of kung fu.

679
00:54:37,151 --> 00:54:39,415
Do you want to learn kung fu?

680
00:54:39,487 --> 00:54:40,476
Yeah!

681
00:54:40,555 --> 00:54:43,820
Then I am your master!

682
00:54:43,891 --> 00:54:45,654
OK!

683
00:54:46,994 --> 00:54:48,086
Don't cry.

684
00:54:48,162 --> 00:54:49,493
OK.

685
00:54:55,236 --> 00:54:57,227
When you focus on kung fu,

686
00:54:57,305 --> 00:54:59,432
when you concentrate...

687
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,007
...you stink.

688
00:55:01,042 --> 00:55:02,942
Perhaps that is my fault.

689
00:55:03,010 --> 00:55:06,468
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

690
00:55:06,547 --> 00:55:09,641
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

691
00:55:09,717 --> 00:55:11,014
...is with this.

692
00:55:11,085 --> 00:55:13,849
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

693
00:55:14,755 --> 00:55:15,813
Good.

694
00:55:15,890 --> 00:55:18,586
When you have been trained, you may eat.

695
00:55:20,027 --> 00:55:21,187
Let us begin.

696
00:56:31,899 --> 00:56:32,991
After you, panda.

697
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:35,035
Just like that?

698
00:56:35,102 --> 00:56:38,765
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

699
00:56:38,839 --> 00:56:43,333
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

700
00:56:48,749 --> 00:56:50,341
Enjoy.

701
00:56:51,919 --> 00:56:53,352
Hey!

702
00:56:53,421 --> 00:56:56,549
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

703
00:56:57,892 --> 00:56:59,359
Hey!

704
00:57:05,633 --> 00:57:07,601
You are free to eat.

705
00:57:07,668 --> 00:57:09,568
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

706
00:58:35,956 --> 00:58:37,480
I'm not hungry.

707
00:58:41,095 --> 00:58:42,289
Master.

708
00:59:12,426 --> 00:59:13,723
Cut it!

709
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,742
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

710
00:59:32,813 --> 00:59:35,805
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

711
00:59:35,883 --> 00:59:38,078
You think I'm a fool?

712
00:59:38,152 --> 00:59:41,781
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

713
00:59:41,856 --> 00:59:45,121
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

714
00:59:45,192 --> 00:59:49,629
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

715
00:59:49,697 --> 00:59:55,294
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

716
00:59:55,369 --> 00:59:58,463
Finally, a worthy opponent.

717
00:59:58,539 --> 01:00:01,030
Our battle will be legendary!

718
01:00:21,028 --> 01:00:22,723
We've got this. Help her.

719
01:00:47,354 --> 01:00:48,343
Monkey!

720
01:00:48,422 --> 01:00:50,253
Go!

721
01:00:50,324 --> 01:00:51,518
What was I thinking?!

722
01:01:01,936 --> 01:01:02,960
Mantis!

723
01:01:08,209 --> 01:01:09,642
Now!

724
01:01:55,556 --> 01:01:57,854
Shifu taught you well.

725
01:02:00,828 --> 01:02:02,762
But he didn't teach you everything.

726
01:02:06,867 --> 01:02:08,357
You have done well, panda.

727
01:02:08,435 --> 01:02:12,132
Done well? Done well?

728
01:02:12,206 --> 01:02:13,503
I've done awesome!

729
01:02:15,209 --> 01:02:18,406
The mark of a true hero is humility.

730
01:02:18,479 --> 01:02:21,175
But, yes, you have done...

731
01:02:21,782 --> 01:02:23,113
...awesome.

732
01:02:30,357 --> 01:02:33,690
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

733
01:02:33,761 --> 01:02:37,197
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

734
01:02:37,264 --> 01:02:39,255
We were no match for his nerve attach.

735
01:02:39,333 --> 01:02:41,563
He's gotten stronger.

736
01:02:41,635 --> 01:02:43,933
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

737
01:02:45,139 --> 01:02:46,128
He's too fast!

738
01:02:46,206 --> 01:02:47,764
Sorry, Po.

739
01:02:49,843 --> 01:02:51,401
I thought we could stop him.

740
01:02:51,478 --> 01:02:53,309
He could have killed you.

741
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:54,438
Why didn't he?

742
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:58,918
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

743
01:02:59,019 --> 01:03:03,319
It might. I mean, a little.

744
01:03:03,357 --> 01:03:04,585
I'm pretty scared.

745
01:03:04,658 --> 01:03:06,148
You can defeat him, panda!

746
01:03:06,226 --> 01:03:09,161
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

747
01:03:09,229 --> 01:03:12,221
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

748
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:15,666
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

749
01:03:21,008 --> 01:03:23,499
You really believe I'm ready?

750
01:03:23,577 --> 01:03:25,238
You are...

751
01:03:25,312 --> 01:03:26,609
...Po.

752
01:04:15,562 --> 01:04:19,123
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

753
01:04:19,199 --> 01:04:21,133
It is yours.

754
01:04:21,201 --> 01:04:24,136
Wait. What happens when I read it?

755
01:04:24,204 --> 01:04:28,231
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

756
01:04:28,308 --> 01:04:30,538
Really? That's cool.

757
01:04:30,611 --> 01:04:33,444
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

758
01:04:33,514 --> 01:04:36,415
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

759
01:04:37,084 --> 01:04:38,517
Can I punch through walls?

760
01:04:38,585 --> 01:04:40,951
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

761
01:04:41,021 --> 01:04:42,215
- Will I?
- Focus.

762
01:04:42,623 --> 01:04:44,022
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

763
01:04:44,091 --> 01:04:46,992
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

764
01:04:47,061 --> 01:04:49,256
Read it and become...

765
01:04:49,329 --> 01:04:51,058
...the Dragon Warrior.

766
01:04:57,971 --> 01:04:59,404
It's impossible to open.

767
01:05:00,374 --> 01:05:03,605
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

768
01:05:05,846 --> 01:05:07,473
Thank you.

769
01:05:07,548 --> 01:05:09,948
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

770
01:05:11,251 --> 01:05:12,775
OK, here goes.

771
01:05:24,798 --> 01:05:26,459
- It's blank.
- What?!

772
01:05:26,533 --> 01:05:30,128
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

773
01:05:35,843 --> 01:05:38,710
Blank. I don't...

774
01:05:38,812 --> 01:05:40,973
I don't understand.

775
01:05:42,282 --> 01:05:44,978
OK. So, like...

776
01:05:45,052 --> 01:05:48,283
...Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

777
01:05:48,355 --> 01:05:50,949
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

778
01:05:51,024 --> 01:05:55,085
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

779
01:05:55,162 --> 01:05:59,292
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

780
01:06:00,334 --> 01:06:02,029
But who will stop Tai Lung?

781
01:06:02,102 --> 01:06:04,593
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

782
01:06:04,671 --> 01:06:06,332
No.

783
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:12,169
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

784
01:06:12,246 --> 01:06:14,646
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

785
01:06:14,715 --> 01:06:17,411
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

786
01:06:17,484 --> 01:06:18,951
for everyone to escape.

787
01:06:19,019 --> 01:06:21,453
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

788
01:06:21,522 --> 01:06:24,355
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

789
01:06:25,325 --> 01:06:27,418
Listen to me, all of you.

790
01:06:27,494 --> 01:06:31,021
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

791
01:06:31,098 --> 01:06:34,090
I am very proud
to have been your master.

792
01:06:54,888 --> 01:06:57,254
We've got to get them out safely.

793
01:06:57,324 --> 01:06:59,656
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

794
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:03,252
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

795
01:07:03,297 --> 01:07:05,060
Crane, light the way.

796
01:07:24,117 --> 01:07:27,143
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

797
01:07:35,862 --> 01:07:37,261
Hey, Dad.

798
01:07:37,864 --> 01:07:39,161
Po!

799
01:07:45,072 --> 01:07:47,165
Good to have you back, son.

800
01:07:49,643 --> 01:07:51,133
Good to be back.

801
01:07:51,211 --> 01:07:52,838
Let's go, Po.

802
01:07:55,349 --> 01:07:58,182
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

803
01:07:58,452 --> 01:08:01,944
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

804
01:08:02,289 --> 01:08:04,382
...no longer slices.

805
01:08:04,458 --> 01:08:07,894
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

806
01:08:07,961 --> 01:08:11,124
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

807
01:08:12,432 --> 01:08:13,626
You like that?

808
01:08:19,773 --> 01:08:24,369
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

809
01:08:24,444 --> 01:08:27,470
It just wasn't meant to be.

810
01:08:30,951 --> 01:08:33,442
Po, forget everything else.

811
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,715
Your destiny still awaits.

812
01:08:35,789 --> 01:08:40,556
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

813
01:08:40,661 --> 01:08:42,925
I don't know, Dad.

814
01:08:42,996 --> 01:08:46,989
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

815
01:08:50,370 --> 01:08:51,462
Po...

816
01:08:51,538 --> 01:08:55,975
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

817
01:08:56,043 --> 01:08:58,102
...a long time ago.

818
01:08:58,178 --> 01:08:59,907
OK.

819
01:09:01,281 --> 01:09:05,411
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

820
01:09:08,155 --> 01:09:12,785
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

821
01:09:12,859 --> 01:09:13,848
...nothing.

822
01:09:15,329 --> 01:09:17,763
You heard me. Nothing!

823
01:09:17,831 --> 01:09:20,299
There is no secret ingredient!

824
01:09:20,367 --> 01:09:23,427
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

825
01:09:23,503 --> 01:09:26,370
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

826
01:09:26,440 --> 01:09:30,843
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

827
01:09:41,521 --> 01:09:44,012
There is no secret ingredient.

828
01:10:06,613 --> 01:10:09,411
I have come home, Master.

829
01:10:09,483 --> 01:10:12,748
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

830
01:10:12,819 --> 01:10:16,755
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

831
01:10:16,823 --> 01:10:19,917
So where is this Po?

832
01:10:21,361 --> 01:10:22,589
Did I scare him off?

833
01:10:22,662 --> 01:10:24,994
This battle is between you and me.

834
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:29,836
So, that is how it's going to be.

835
01:10:29,903 --> 01:10:31,928
That is how it must be.

836
01:10:46,086 --> 01:10:50,648
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

837
01:10:50,724 --> 01:10:53,090
Obeying your master is not weakness!

838
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:55,958
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

839
01:10:56,029 --> 01:10:58,190
You always knew.

840
01:10:58,265 --> 01:11:03,202
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

841
01:11:04,337 --> 01:11:06,862
What did you do?!

842
01:11:09,409 --> 01:11:10,535
Nothing!

843
01:11:10,610 --> 01:11:13,443
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

844
01:11:13,513 --> 01:11:15,481
Not your fault?!

845
01:11:15,549 --> 01:11:17,608
Who filled my head with dreams?!

846
01:11:17,684 --> 01:11:19,914
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

847
01:11:19,986 --> 01:11:22,716
Who denied me my destiny?!

848
01:11:31,965 --> 01:11:34,559
It was never my decision to make!

849
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:41,337
It is now.

850
01:11:46,413 --> 01:11:50,179
Give me the scroll!

851
01:11:50,250 --> 01:11:51,478
I would rather die.

852
01:12:41,635 --> 01:12:44,729
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

853
01:12:44,905 --> 01:12:47,396
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

854
01:12:48,375 --> 01:12:49,865
Tell me!

855
01:12:50,410 --> 01:12:52,139
Tell me!

856
01:13:02,455 --> 01:13:05,822
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

857
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:10,293
From the first moment, I've been...

858
01:13:10,363 --> 01:13:12,661
...proud of you.

859
01:13:12,732 --> 01:13:15,098
And it was my pride...

860
01:13:15,168 --> 01:13:17,193
...that blinded me.

861
01:13:17,270 --> 01:13:20,831
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

862
01:13:21,841 --> 01:13:24,105
...what I...

863
01:13:24,177 --> 01:13:26,168
...was turning you into.

864
01:13:26,980 --> 01:13:28,948
I'm...

865
01:13:29,015 --> 01:13:30,004
I'm sorry.

866
01:13:38,525 --> 01:13:41,255
I don't want your apology.

867
01:13:41,328 --> 01:13:42,852
I want my scroll!

868
01:13:44,965 --> 01:13:47,297
What?!

869
01:13:47,367 --> 01:13:48,595
Where is it?!

870
01:13:49,603 --> 01:13:54,199
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

871
01:13:55,342 --> 01:13:58,470
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

872
01:13:58,545 --> 01:13:59,876
Never.

873
01:14:00,814 --> 01:14:01,803
Never.

874
01:14:08,755 --> 01:14:10,052
Stairs.

875
01:14:12,492 --> 01:14:14,289
Who are you?

876
01:14:14,361 --> 01:14:19,389
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

877
01:14:22,402 --> 01:14:23,733
You?

878
01:14:24,704 --> 01:14:26,672
Him? He's a panda.

879
01:14:26,740 --> 01:14:30,608
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

880
01:14:30,677 --> 01:14:32,611
Don't tempt me.

881
01:14:32,679 --> 01:14:36,706
No. I'm gonna use this.

882
01:14:36,783 --> 01:14:38,410
You want it? Come and get it.

883
01:14:40,153 --> 01:14:41,450
Finally!

884
01:15:07,414 --> 01:15:08,881
That scroll is mine!

885
01:16:02,635 --> 01:16:03,659
Lightning!

886
01:16:38,872 --> 01:16:40,863
The scroll has given him power!

887
01:16:41,508 --> 01:16:43,066
No!

888
01:17:19,546 --> 01:17:23,482
Finally! Oh, yes.

889
01:17:23,550 --> 01:17:28,419
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

890
01:17:32,725 --> 01:17:34,750
It's nothing!

891
01:17:36,729 --> 01:17:39,323
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

892
01:17:40,099 --> 01:17:41,123
What?

893
01:17:42,368 --> 01:17:44,165
There is no secret ingredient.

894
01:17:47,707 --> 01:17:48,935
It's just you.

895
01:17:58,718 --> 01:17:59,776
Stop it!

896
01:17:59,853 --> 01:18:01,616
I'm gonna pee.

897
01:18:03,189 --> 01:18:04,816
Don't.

898
01:18:04,891 --> 01:18:06,552
Don't! Don't!

899
01:19:13,826 --> 01:19:15,623
You...

900
01:19:15,695 --> 01:19:17,925
...can't defeat me.

901
01:19:22,368 --> 01:19:23,596
You...

902
01:19:24,938 --> 01:19:26,735
...you're just a big...

903
01:19:26,806 --> 01:19:28,398
...fat...

904
01:19:28,474 --> 01:19:29,463
...panda!

905
01:19:30,443 --> 01:19:33,571
I'm not a big fat panda.

906
01:19:33,646 --> 01:19:35,944
I'm the big fat panda.

907
01:19:38,217 --> 01:19:39,650
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

908
01:19:39,719 --> 01:19:41,152
Oh, you know this hold?

909
01:19:41,220 --> 01:19:45,179
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

910
01:19:45,258 --> 01:19:46,953
Nope.

911
01:19:47,026 --> 01:19:49,221
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

912
01:20:09,749 --> 01:20:10,977
Look!

913
01:20:12,018 --> 01:20:14,111
The Dragon Warrior.

914
01:20:41,581 --> 01:20:46,450
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

915
01:20:48,521 --> 01:20:49,613
Yes!

916
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,448
Thanks, Dad.

917
01:21:01,734 --> 01:21:03,133
Hey, guys.

918
01:21:07,874 --> 01:21:09,205
Master.

919
01:21:09,275 --> 01:21:10,708
Master.

920
01:21:13,613 --> 01:21:15,376
Master?

921
01:21:15,448 --> 01:21:16,915
Master Shifu!

922
01:21:29,962 --> 01:21:31,327
Master!

923
01:21:31,397 --> 01:21:33,490
Shifu, are you OK?!

924
01:21:35,868 --> 01:21:37,267
Po.

925
01:21:37,336 --> 01:21:39,270
You're alive.

926
01:21:39,338 --> 01:21:40,566
Or we're both dead.

927
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:44,576
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

928
01:21:44,644 --> 01:21:45,770
You did?

929
01:21:50,049 --> 01:21:55,783
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

930
01:21:55,855 --> 01:21:59,347
You are the Dragon Warrior.

931
01:22:00,093 --> 01:22:02,561
You have brought peace...

932
01:22:02,628 --> 01:22:05,392
...to this valley...

933
01:22:05,465 --> 01:22:07,660
...and...

934
01:22:07,733 --> 01:22:09,360
...and to me.

935
01:22:09,435 --> 01:22:10,697
Thank you.

936
01:22:12,538 --> 01:22:15,769
Thank you, Po.

937
01:22:15,842 --> 01:22:18,436
Thank you. Thank you.

938
01:22:23,950 --> 01:22:28,944
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

939
01:22:29,021 --> 01:22:31,751
I'm not dying, you idiot!

940
01:22:31,824 --> 01:22:33,792
Dragon Warrior...

941
01:22:35,061 --> 01:22:39,896
...I am simply at peace. Finally.

942
01:22:42,635 --> 01:22:45,570
So, I should stop talking?

943
01:22:46,272 --> 01:22:47,899
If you can.

944
01:23:05,992 --> 01:23:07,584
Want to get something to eat?

945
01:23:10,263 --> 01:23:11,355
Yeah.

You are a natural

Why is that so hard to see?

957
01:23:59,745 --> 01:24:03,875
Maybe it's just because
You keep on looking at me

958
01:24:03,916 --> 01:24:08,012
The journey's a lonely one
So much more than we know
