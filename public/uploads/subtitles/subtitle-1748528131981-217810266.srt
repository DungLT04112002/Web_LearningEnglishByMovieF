1
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,440
Legend tells of a legendary warrior...

2
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:44,670
...whose kung fu skills
were the stuff of legend.

3
00:00:45,810 --> 00:00:50,370
He traveled the land
in search of worthy foes.

4
00:01:00,220 --> 00:01:05,920
I see you like to chew.
Maybe you should chew on my fist!

5
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,520
The warrior said nothing,
for his mouth was full.

6
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,760
Then he swallowed. And then he spoke.

7
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,140
Enough talk. Let's fight!

8
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:16,640
Shashabooey!

9
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:21,440
He was so deadly in fact,

10
00:01:21,510 --> 00:01:25,210
that his enemies would go blind from
overexposure to pure awesomeness.

11
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,480
- My eyes!
- He's too awesome!

12
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:30,320
- And attractive.
- How can we repay you?

13
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:33,560
There is no charge for awesomeness.

14
00:01:33,620 --> 00:01:36,250
Or attractiveness.

15
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:37,590
Kablooey!

16
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:40,390
It mattered not how many foes he faced.

17
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:43,330
They were no match for his bodacity!

18
00:01:55,850 --> 00:02:00,510
Never before had a panda
been so feared! And so loved.

19
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:04,080
Even the most heroic heroes in China,

20
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,390
the Furious Five,

21
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:09,390
bowed in respect
to this great master.

22
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,290
We should hang out.

23
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,490
Agreed.

24
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:17,490
But hanging out would have to wait.

25
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,010
Because when you're facing
the 10,000 demons of Demon Mountain,

26
00:02:22,070 --> 00:02:24,870
there's only one thing
that matters and that's...

27
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:26,700
Po! Get up!

28
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:28,540
You'll be later for work!

29
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:29,870
What?

30
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,650
Po! Get up!

31
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,460
Po. What are you doing up there?

32
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,800
Nothing.

33
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:06,080
Monkey! Mantis! Crane! Viper! Tigress!

34
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,820
Po! Let's go! You're late for work.

35
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:17,260
Coming!

36
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:28,800
Sorry, Dad.

37
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:31,710
Sorry doesn't make the noodles.

38
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,140
What were you doing up there?
All that noise.

39
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,700
Nothing. I just had a crazy dream.

40
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,010
About what?

41
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:39,670
What were you dreaming about?

42
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,270
What was I?

43
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,110
I was dreaming about...

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,150
...noodles.

45
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:51,290
Noodles? You were really
dreaming about noodles?

46
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,920
Yeah. What else
would I be dreaming about?

47
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,470
Careful! That soup is sharp.

48
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,000
Oh, happy day!

49
00:03:58,070 --> 00:04:01,970
My son, finally having the noodle dream!

50
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,370
You don't know how long I've been
waiting for this moment.

51
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,310
This is a sign, Po.

52
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,180
A sign of what?

53
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,880
You are almost ready to be entrusted
with the secret ingredient

54
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:18,220
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

55
00:04:18,290 --> 00:04:23,420
Then you will fulfill your destiny
and take over the restaurant!

56
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:26,990
As I took it over from my father,
who took it over from his father...

57
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,730
...who won it from a friend in mahjong.

58
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,500
Dad, Dad, Dad, it was just a dream.

59
00:04:32,570 --> 00:04:34,870
No, it was the dream.

60
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:38,500
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs through our veins.

61
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,480
But, Dad, didn't you ever want
to do something else?

62
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,410
Something besides noodles?

63
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:47,420
Actually, when I was young and crazy,

64
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:51,550
I thought about running away
and learning how to make tofu.

65
00:04:51,620 --> 00:04:52,750
Why didn't you?

66
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,590
Because it was a stupid dream.

67
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
Can you imagine me making tofu?

68
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,290
Tofu.

69
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:04,770
No! We all have our place in this world.

70
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:07,400
Mine is here, and yours is...

71
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:08,700
I know, is here.

72
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:11,900
No, it's at tables 2, 5, 7, and 12

73
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:14,040
Service with a smile.

74
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:47,640
Well done, students...
if you were trying to disappoint me.

75
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,870
Tigress, you need more ferocity!
Monkey, greater speed.

76
00:05:50,950 --> 00:05:53,850
Crane, height. Viper, subtlety.
Mantis...

77
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,750
- Master Shifu.
- What?!

78
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:58,250
It's Master Oogway. He wants to see you.

79
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:12,600
Master Oogway, you summoned me?
Is something wrong?

80
00:06:18,940 --> 00:06:23,380
Why must something be wrong
for me to want to see my old friend?

81
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:25,570
So, nothing's wrong?

82
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:28,280
Well, I didn't say that.

83
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:48,000
You were saying?

84
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,170
I have had a vision.

85
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,970
Tai Lung will return.

86
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:01,480
That is impossible! He is in prison.

87
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:04,320
Nothing is impossible.

88
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:06,180
Zeng!

89
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:08,590
Fly to Chorh-Gom prison and tell them

90
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,990
to double the guards, double
their weapons, double everything!

91
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:13,960
Tai Lung does not leave that prison!

92
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:15,500
Yes, Master Shifu!

93
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:22,500
One often meets his destiny
on the road he takes to avoid it.

94
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:26,570
We must do something! We can't let him
march on the valley, take his revenge!

95
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,630
He'll...

96
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:30,010
Your mind is like this water,
my friend.

97
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,520
When it is agitated,
it becomes difficult to see.

98
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,680
But if you allow it to settle...

99
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:39,750
...the answer becomes clear.

100
00:07:43,090 --> 00:07:44,860
The Dragon Scroll.

101
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,290
It is time.

102
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,100
But who? Who is worthy to be trusted
with the secret to limitless power?

103
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:56,900
To become the Dragon Warrior?

104
00:07:56,970 --> 00:07:58,440
I don't know.

105
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:02,200
Excuse me. Pardon me. Sorry.

106
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,140
Watch it!

107
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,700
Sorry. Suck it up!

108
00:08:07,150 --> 00:08:09,880
Sorry. A thousand pardons.

109
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:10,940
What?

110
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:16,320
Master Oogway's choosing
the Dragon Warrior! Today!

111
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,990
Everyone! Get to the Jade Palace! One of
the Five is gonna get the Dragon Scroll!

112
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:24,120
We've waited 1,000 years for this!
Take the bowl!

113
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:28,330
This is the greatest day
in kung fu history! Just go!

114
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,400
Po! Where are you going?

115
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,640
To the Jade Palace.

116
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:36,010
You're forgetting your noodle cart.

117
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:40,640
The whole valley will be there,
and you'll sell noodles to all of them.

118
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,120
Selling noodles?

119
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,220
But, Dad, I was thinking, maybe I...

120
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:49,420
- Yeah?
- I was thinking maybe I...

121
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:57,830
...could also sell the bean buns.
They're about to go bad.

122
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,600
That's my boy!

123
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,930
I told you that dream was a sign.

124
00:09:01,970 --> 00:09:04,940
Yeah. Glad I had it.

125
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:11,550
- I'm a kung fu warrior!
- Me, too!

126
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:14,140
- There's spots at the top.
- Let's go.

127
00:09:48,650 --> 00:09:51,420
Come on. Come on!

128
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:53,350
Almost there.

129
00:09:53,420 --> 00:09:54,580
What?

130
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:57,320
No! Oh, no!

131
00:09:59,660 --> 00:10:03,220
- Sorry, Po.
- We'll bring you back a souvenir.

132
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:11,160
No. I'll bring me back a souvenir.

133
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:17,780
It is an historic day.

134
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,610
Isn't it, Master Oogway?

135
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:24,550
Yes, and one I feared
I would not live to see.

136
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:26,610
Are your students ready?

137
00:10:26,690 --> 00:10:28,450
Yes, Master Oogway.

138
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:31,360
Know this, old friend.

139
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:35,760
Whomever I choose will not only bring
peace to the valley...

140
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,460
...but also to you.

141
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:45,940
Let the tournament begin!

142
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,750
Yeah.

143
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,490
No, no, wait!

144
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,890
I'm coming! Wait, wait!

145
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,190
Yes!

146
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,570
Hey! Open the door!

147
00:11:13,470 --> 00:11:16,560
Let me in!

148
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

149
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:22,970
it is my great honor
to present to you... Tigress!

150
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:27,210
Viper! Crane! Monkey! Mantis!

151
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,620
The Furious Five!

152
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,870
Yeah, the Furious Five!

153
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:46,500
Warriors, prepare!

154
00:11:46,570 --> 00:11:49,130
Wait. No. Oh, peeky-hole.

155
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,540
- Ready for battle!
- Yeah.

156
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:54,600
The Thousand Tongues of Fire.

157
00:11:56,910 --> 00:11:58,040
Look at that.

158
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:00,110
Hey! Get out of the way!

159
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,650
And finally Master Tigress!

160
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:42,490
And believe me, citizens,
you have not seen anything yet.

161
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:43,820
I know!

162
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:48,990
Master Tigress! Face Iron Ox
and his Blades of Death.

163
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:05,850
I sense the Dragon Warrior is among us.

164
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:14,010
Citizens of the Valley of Peace,

165
00:13:14,090 --> 00:13:18,620
Master Oogway will now choose
the Dragon Warrior!

166
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,760
Oh, no! No, no, wait!

167
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:24,520
Yeah.

168
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:42,080
Po!

169
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,090
What are you doing?!

170
00:13:44,150 --> 00:13:46,710
What does it look like I'm doing?! Stop!

171
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm going to see the Dragon Warrior!

172
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:56,160
But I don't understand.
You finally had the noodle dream!

173
00:13:57,030 --> 00:14:00,060
I lied. I don't dream
about noodles, Dad.

174
00:14:02,870 --> 00:14:06,400
I love kung fu!

175
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:23,420
Come on, son. Let's get back to work.

176
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:27,430
OK.

177
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,270
Come back!

178
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,290
What's going on?

179
00:15:02,070 --> 00:15:03,730
Where?

180
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,790
What are you pointing?

181
00:15:10,540 --> 00:15:12,530
OK. Sorry.

182
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,080
I just wanted to see
who the Dragon Warrior was.

183
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,080
How interesting.

184
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:20,450
Master, are you pointing at me?

185
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,540
- Him.
- Who?

186
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:26,750
- You.
- Me?

187
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:32,320
The universe has brought us
the Dragon Warrior!

188
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,000
- What?
- What?!

189
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,760
- What?!
- What?!

190
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:48,240
Stop, wait! Who told you to?

191
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,250
Master Oogway, wait.

192
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,590
That flabby panda can't possibly be
the answer to our problem.

193
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:07,360
You were about to point at Tigress
and that thing fell in front of her!

194
00:16:07,430 --> 00:16:08,860
That was just an accident!

195
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:11,700
There are no accidents.

196
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,580
Forgive us, Master. We have failed you.

197
00:16:29,650 --> 00:16:32,990
No. If the panda
has not quit by morning

198
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,390
then I will have failed you.

199
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:56,410
Wait! Wait, wait, wait!
I bring a message...

200
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,740
...from Master Shifu.

201
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,580
What?!

202
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:05,990
"Double the guard?!"

203
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:07,850
"Extra precautions?!"

204
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,260
"Your prison may not be adequate?!"

205
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:16,820
You doubt my prison security?!

206
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,770
Absolutely not.

207
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,960
Shifu does. I'm just the messenger.

208
00:17:22,040 --> 00:17:25,670
I'll give you a message
for your Master Shifu.

209
00:17:26,310 --> 00:17:29,440
Escape from Chorh-Gom prison
is impossible!

210
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,620
Impressive, isn't it?

211
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:39,380
It's very impressive.

212
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,950
It's very impressive.

213
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:43,690
One way in, one way out.

214
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:47,860
One thousand guards and one prisoner.

215
00:17:47,930 --> 00:17:50,460
Yes, except that prisoner...

216
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,230
...is Tai Lung.

217
00:17:56,310 --> 00:17:58,040
Take us down.

218
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,910
What are you doing?

219
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,730
Oh, my.

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:25,060
Behold Tai Lung.

221
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm just gonna wait right here.

222
00:18:29,870 --> 00:18:34,170
It's nothing to worry about.
It's perfectly safe.

223
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,510
Crossbows! At the ready!

224
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,380
Crossbows?

225
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:41,010
Hey, tough guy, did you hear?

226
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:45,580
Oogway's giving someone the Dragon
Scroll, and it's not gonna be you.

227
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,320
Don't get him mad.

228
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,190
What's he gonna do about it?
I've got him completely immobilized.

229
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:00,390
Did I step on the wittle kitty's tail?

230
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,300
I'm good. I've seen enough.

231
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,770
I'll tell Shifu he
has nothing to worry about.

232
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,070
No, he doesn't.

233
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,370
I'll tell him that.

234
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:10,310
Can we please go now?

235
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,320
Dragon Warrior! Dragon Warrior!

236
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:36,470
Wait a second!

237
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,140
I think there's been a slight mistake.
Everyone seems to think that I'm...

238
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:52,420
The Sacred Hall of Warriors! No way!

239
00:19:53,390 --> 00:19:54,820
Look at this place.

240
00:19:56,990 --> 00:20:01,430
Master Flying Rhino's armor,
with authentic battle damage!

241
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,360
The Sword of Heroes!

242
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,700
Said to be so sharp you can cut yourself
just by looking.

243
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,440
The Invisible Trident of Destiny!

244
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,280
I've only seen paintings
of that painting.

245
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:26,110
No!

246
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:30,220
The legendary Urn
of Whispering Warriors.

247
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:33,460
Said to contain the souls
of the entire Tenshu Army.

248
00:20:36,830 --> 00:20:37,960
Hello.

249
00:20:38,030 --> 00:20:40,370
Have you finished sight-seeing?

250
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,530
Sorry, I should have come to you first.

251
00:20:42,610 --> 00:20:44,570
My patience is wearing thin.

252
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,470
Well, I mean, it's not like you
were going anywhere.

253
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,910
- Would you turn around?
- Sure.

254
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,000
How's it going?

255
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,510
How do you get 5,000...
Master Shifu!

256
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:57,880
Someone... broke that.

257
00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:00,320
But I'll fix it. Do you have some...

258
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:02,490
...glue?

259
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,480
A splinter.

260
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:09,560
So you're the legendary Dragon Warrior?

261
00:21:09,630 --> 00:21:12,760
- I guess so.
- Wrong!

262
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:16,570
You are not the Dragon Warrior. You will
never be the Dragon Warrior until...

263
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,570
...you have learned the secret
of the Dragon Scroll.

264
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,210
So, how does this work?

265
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,180
Do you have a ladder,
or a trampoline, or?

266
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,550
You think it's that easy?
That I'll just hand you the secret

267
00:21:32,620 --> 00:21:34,520
- to limitless power?
- No, I...

268
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,620
One must first master
the highest level of kung fu.

269
00:21:37,690 --> 00:21:41,760
And that is impossible
if that one is someone like you.

270
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:42,860
Someone like me?

271
00:21:42,930 --> 00:21:47,600
Yes, look at you!
This fat butt! Flabby arms!

272
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:50,140
Those are sensitive in the flabby parts.

273
00:21:50,210 --> 00:21:53,040
And this ridiculous belly.

274
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:56,370
And utter disregard
for personal hygiene.

275
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,610
Now, wait a minute.
That's uncalled for.

276
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:01,210
Don't stand that close.
I can smell your breath.

277
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,180
Listen, Oogway said I was...

278
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:05,920
The Wuxi Finger Hold.
Not the Wuxi Finger Hold!

279
00:22:05,990 --> 00:22:08,720
Oh, you know this hold?

280
00:22:08,790 --> 00:22:11,450
Developed by Master Wuxi
in the Third Dynasty.

281
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,290
Then you know what happens
when I flex my pinky.

282
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,830
- No, no!
- You know the hardest part of this?

283
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:21,770
The hardest part is cleaning up
afterwards.

284
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,970
OK, OK, take it easy.

285
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:26,470
Now listen closely, panda.

286
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:29,670
Oogway may have picked you,
but when I'm through with you,

287
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:34,650
I promise you, you're going to wish
he hadn't! Are we clear?

288
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,950
Yeah, we're clear. We're so clear.

289
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:39,750
Good.

290
00:22:39,820 --> 00:22:41,760
I can't wait to get started.

291
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,630
- Let's begin.
- Wait, wait, wait.

292
00:23:23,930 --> 00:23:25,230
What?

293
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:29,270
- Now?
- Yes, now.

294
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,640
Unless the great Oogway was wrong
and you are not the Dragon Warrior.

295
00:23:33,710 --> 00:23:35,270
Oh, OK, well...

296
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:39,340
I don't know
if I can do all of those moves.

297
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:42,180
Well, if we don't try,
we'll never know, will we?

298
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:46,090
Yeah, it's just, maybe we can find
something more suited to my level.

299
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:47,210
What level is that?

300
00:23:47,290 --> 00:23:50,750
Well, I'm not a master, but...

301
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:53,590
...let's just start at zero. Level zero.

302
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:57,760
No. There is no such thing
as level zero.

303
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:00,600
- Maybe I can start with that.
- That?

304
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:05,770
We use that for training children and
propping the door open when it's hot.

305
00:24:05,810 --> 00:24:07,170
But if you insist...

306
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,010
The Furious Five!

307
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,350
You're bigger than your action figures.
Except, you, Mantis. You're the same.

308
00:24:17,620 --> 00:24:20,180
Go ahead, panda.
Show us what you can do.

309
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:25,430
Are they gonna watch, or should I wait
till they get back to work?

310
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,480
Hit it.

311
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:31,230
OK, yeah. I mean, I just ate.
So I'm still digesting.

312
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:35,070
So my kung fu might not be
as good as... later on.

313
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:36,260
Just hit it.

314
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:38,230
All right.

315
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:42,610
What you got? You got nothing,
'cause I got it right here.

316
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:45,700
You picking on my friends?
Get ready to feel thunder.

317
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:47,980
I'm coming at you with crazy feet.

318
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:51,040
Come on. I'm a blur.
You've never seen bear style.

319
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,920
You've only seen praying mantis.

320
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:54,920
Or monkey style.

321
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:57,920
Or I could come at you snickety-snake.

322
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,360
Would you hit it!

323
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:02,590
All right. All right.

324
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:11,400
Why don't you try again?
A little harder.

325
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,400
How's that?

326
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:26,680
That hurts.

327
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:35,860
This will be easier than I thought.

328
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:38,420
I'm feeling a little nauseous!

329
00:25:39,270 --> 00:25:40,570
Those are hard!

330
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,370
My tenders.

331
00:26:14,470 --> 00:26:16,170
How did I do?

332
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:20,040
There is now a level zero.

333
00:26:20,110 --> 00:26:22,510
- There's no words.
- No denying that.

334
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,910
What was Master Oogway thinking?

335
00:26:24,980 --> 00:26:27,280
The poor guy's gonna get himself killed.

336
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:29,840
He is so mighty!

337
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:34,750
The Dragon Warrior fell out of the sky
on a ball of fire!

338
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:37,660
When he walks, the very ground shakes!

339
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,930
One would think Master Oogway would
choose someone who knew kung fu.

340
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,020
Yeah, or could at least touch his toes.

341
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:47,500
Or even see his toes.

342
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,020
OK.

343
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,460
Great.

344
00:27:38,320 --> 00:27:39,910
Hi. You're up.

345
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:41,390
I am now.

346
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:42,960
I was just...

347
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:44,930
Some day, huh?

348
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:49,400
That kung fu stuff is hard work, right?
Are your biceps sore?

349
00:27:50,430 --> 00:27:55,230
I've had a long
and rather disappointing day, so...

350
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:59,310
Yeah, I should probably
get to sleep now.

351
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:01,840
- Yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course.
- OK, thanks.

352
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:04,740
It's just...
Man, I'm such a big fan!

353
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,510
You guys were amazing
at the Battle of Weeping River.

354
00:28:07,580 --> 00:28:11,080
Outnumbered a thousand to one,
but you didn't stop. You just...

355
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:16,190
Sorry about that.

356
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,750
Look, you don't belong here.

357
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,360
I know. I know. You're right.

358
00:28:23,430 --> 00:28:25,920
I don't have... I just...

359
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,530
My whole life I dreamed of...

360
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:32,470
No, I meant you don't belong here.
I mean, in this room. This is my room.

361
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,900
Property of Crane.

362
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,840
OK. Right, right.

363
00:28:37,910 --> 00:28:40,440
So, you want to get to sleep.

364
00:28:40,520 --> 00:28:42,310
- Yeah.
- I'm keeping you up.

365
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,510
We got big things tomorrow.

366
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:48,790
All right. You're awesome.
Last thing I'm gonna say. Bye-bye.

367
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:53,790
What was that?

368
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,300
I didn't say anything.

369
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,530
OK. All right. Good night.

370
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,790
Sleep well.

371
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,470
That seemed a little awkward.

372
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,930
Master Tigress!
I didn't mean to wake you.

373
00:29:08,010 --> 00:29:10,710
- You don't belong here.
- Yeah, of course.

374
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,080
This is your room.

375
00:29:12,150 --> 00:29:15,450
I mean, you don't belong
in the Jade Palace.

376
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,880
You're a disgrace to kung fu,
and if you have

377
00:29:17,950 --> 00:29:21,580
any respect for who we are
and what we do,

378
00:29:21,920 --> 00:29:24,090
you will be gone by morning.

379
00:29:29,530 --> 00:29:31,160
Big fan!

380
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:42,410
I see you have found the Sacred
Peach Tree of Heavenly Wisdom.

381
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,450
Is that what this is? Sorry. I thought
it was just a regular peach tree.

382
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:54,460
I understand.
You eat when you are upset.

383
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:58,520
Upset? I'm not upset.
What makes you think I'm upset.

384
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:02,200
So why are you so upset?

385
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:10,860
I probably sucked more today
than anyone in the history of kung fu.

386
00:30:10,940 --> 00:30:14,570
In the history of China.
In the history of sucking!

387
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,740
Probably.

388
00:30:15,810 --> 00:30:19,510
And the Five! Man, you should've
seen them! They totally hate me.

389
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:20,570
Totally.

390
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:24,710
How is Shifu ever going to turn me
into the Dragon Warrior?

391
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,760
I mean, I'm not like the Five.

392
00:30:28,820 --> 00:30:32,390
I've got no claws, no wings, no venom.

393
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:35,400
Even Mantis has those... thingies.

394
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,400
Maybe I should just quit
and go back to making noodles.

395
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:45,730
Quit, don't quit.

396
00:30:45,810 --> 00:30:49,840
Noodles, don't noodles.

397
00:30:49,910 --> 00:30:54,580
You are too concerned
with what was and what will be.

398
00:30:54,650 --> 00:30:56,520
There's a saying:

399
00:30:56,590 --> 00:30:59,020
Yesterday is history,

400
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,560
tomorrow is a mystery,

401
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:04,720
but today is a gift.

402
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:07,590
That is why it is called the present.

403
00:31:37,590 --> 00:31:39,960
- Oh, no!
- What's happening?!

404
00:31:40,030 --> 00:31:42,520
To your battle stations! Go! Go! Go!

405
00:31:51,270 --> 00:31:52,900
Fire crossbows!

406
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,310
Fire!

407
00:31:56,950 --> 00:31:57,970
Fire!

408
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:08,320
Tai Lung is free! I must warn Shifu.

409
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:11,220
- Not going anywhere! Neither is he!
- Let go of me!

410
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,420
Bring it up!

411
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,650
Wait! Bring it back!

412
00:32:35,450 --> 00:32:39,440
- He's coming this way!
- He won't get far. Archers!

413
00:33:47,190 --> 00:33:50,420
We're dead. So very, very dead.

414
00:33:51,130 --> 00:33:53,190
Not yet we're not. Now!

415
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:43,570
- Can we run now?
- Yes.

416
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:05,830
I'm glad Shifu sent you.

417
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:10,940
I was beginning to think
I'd been forgotten.

418
00:35:11,010 --> 00:35:13,030
Fly back there and tell them...

419
00:35:13,110 --> 00:35:16,840
...the real Dragon Warrior
is coming home.

420
00:35:28,820 --> 00:35:30,350
Good morning, Master!

421
00:35:31,830 --> 00:35:33,450
Panda!

422
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:34,520
Panda!

423
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:36,090
Wake up!

424
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,860
He's quit.

425
00:35:42,870 --> 00:35:47,930
What do we do now, with the panda gone?
Who will be the Dragon Warrior?

426
00:35:48,010 --> 00:35:51,100
All we can do is resume our training
and trust that in time,

427
00:35:51,180 --> 00:35:53,810
the true Dragon Warrior
will be revealed.

428
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,840
What are you doing here?!

429
00:35:57,790 --> 00:35:59,780
Hi! Good morning, Master!

430
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:01,750
I thought I'd warm up a little.

431
00:36:03,890 --> 00:36:04,880
You're stuck.

432
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,330
Stuck? Nah. What? Stuck?

433
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:11,130
Nah. This is one of my...
Yeah, I'm stuck.

434
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,130
- Help him.
- Oh, dear.

435
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:16,740
Maybe on three. One, two...

436
00:36:17,810 --> 00:36:19,000
...three.

437
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:22,440
- Thank you.
- Don't mention it.

438
00:36:22,510 --> 00:36:25,450
- No, really, I appreciate...
- Ever.

439
00:36:25,510 --> 00:36:29,810
You actually thought you could learn
to do a full split in one night?

440
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:33,250
It takes years to develop
one's flexibility!

441
00:36:33,320 --> 00:36:37,090
And years longer to apply it in combat!

442
00:36:46,500 --> 00:36:48,030
Put that down!

443
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:52,600
The only souvenirs we collect here are
bloody knuckles and broken bones.

444
00:36:52,670 --> 00:36:55,610
Yeah! Excellent.

445
00:36:56,410 --> 00:36:57,610
Let's get started.

446
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,780
- Are you ready?
- I was born re...

447
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:06,740
I'm sorry, brother.
I thought you said you were ready.

448
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:10,120
That was awesome! Let's go again!

449
00:37:36,490 --> 00:37:39,420
I've been taking it easy on you, panda.
But no more.

450
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:41,820
Your next opponent will be me.

451
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:43,650
All right! Yeah, let's go!

452
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,220
Step forth.

453
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:51,760
The true path to victory is to find
your opponent's weakness...

454
00:37:51,830 --> 00:37:53,700
...and make him suffer for it.

455
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:55,100
Oh, yeah!

456
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:58,540
To take his strength
and use it against him...

457
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:01,100
...until he finally falls...

458
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:02,200
...or quits.

459
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,240
A real warrior never quits.

460
00:38:04,310 --> 00:38:07,510
Don't worry, Master. I will never quit!

461
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:21,090
If he's smart,
he won't come back up those steps.

462
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:22,490
But he will.

463
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,860
He's not going to quit, is he?

464
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:27,700
He's not going to quit bouncing,
I'll tell you that.

465
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:42,640
I thought you said acupuncture
would make me feel better.

466
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:43,740
Trust me, it will.

467
00:38:43,820 --> 00:38:47,450
It's just not easy finding the right
nerve points under all this...

468
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:50,180
- Fat?
- Fur. I was going to say fur.

469
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,250
Sure you were.

470
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:55,390
Who am I to judge a warrior
based on his size? Look at me.

471
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:57,550
I'm over here.

472
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,100
Maybe you should look at this again.

473
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:03,600
Oh, OK.

474
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:08,400
Stop it. Stop!

475
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:12,510
I know Master Shifu is trying
to inspire me and all...

476
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:16,510
...but if I didn't know better,
I'd say he was trying to get rid of me.

477
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,860
I know he can seem kind of heartless...

478
00:39:24,490 --> 00:39:26,460
...but he wasn't always like that.

479
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,860
According to legend,

480
00:39:27,930 --> 00:39:32,460
there was once a time when
Master Shifu actually used to smile.

481
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,470
- No!
- Yes.

482
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,800
But that was before.

483
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:37,860
Before what?

484
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:39,270
Before Tai Lung.

485
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:41,930
We're not really supposed
to talk about him.

486
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:45,000
Well, if he's going to stay here,
he should know.

487
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:47,010
Guys, guys, I know about Tai Lung.

488
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:52,540
He was a student. The first ever to
master the thousand scrolls of kung fu.

489
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:56,790
And then he turned bad,
and now he's in jail.

490
00:39:56,860 --> 00:39:58,990
He wasn't just a student.

491
00:40:03,330 --> 00:40:06,160
Shifu found him as a cub...

492
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,740
...and he raised him as his son.

493
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:16,170
And when the boy showed
talent in kung fu...

494
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,540
...Shifu trained him.

495
00:40:19,610 --> 00:40:23,740
He believed in him. He told him
he was destined for greatness.

496
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:27,180
It was never enough for Tai Lung.

497
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,520
He wanted the Dragon Scroll.

498
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:35,890
But Oogway saw darkness
in his heart and refused.

499
00:40:36,230 --> 00:40:39,930
Outraged, Tai Lung
laid waste to the valley.

500
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,430
He tried to take the scroll by force.

501
00:40:44,510 --> 00:40:49,100
And Shifu had to destroy
what he had created.

502
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:52,640
But how could he?

503
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:10,960
Shifu loved Tai Lung
like he had never loved anyone before.

504
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,470
Or since.

505
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:31,820
And now he has a chance
to make things right.

506
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:34,120
To train the true Dragon Warrior.

507
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:37,220
And he's stuck with you.

508
00:41:37,290 --> 00:41:41,160
A big fat panda
who treats it like a joke.

509
00:41:42,060 --> 00:41:43,050
That is it!

510
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:46,260
Wait! My fault!
I accidentally tweaked his facial nerve.

511
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:51,170
And may have also stopped his heart.

512
00:41:54,840 --> 00:41:56,400
Inner peace.

513
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,670
Inner peace.

514
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:04,350
Inner...

515
00:42:05,950 --> 00:42:07,850
Inner peace.

516
00:42:10,830 --> 00:42:15,350
Would whoever is making
that flapping sound quiet down?!

517
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:19,860
Inner...

518
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:26,530
Oh, Zeng.

519
00:42:26,610 --> 00:42:28,200
Excellent.

520
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:30,210
I could use some good news right now.

521
00:42:37,990 --> 00:42:39,350
Master! Master!

522
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:44,290
I have... It's...
It's very bad news.

523
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:46,730
Shifu.

524
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:50,200
There is just news.
There is no good or bad.

525
00:42:50,270 --> 00:42:53,930
Master, your vision.
Your vision was right.

526
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,400
Tai Lung has broken out of prison.
He's on his way.

527
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,600
That is bad news...

528
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,010
...if you do not believe
that the Dragon Warrior can stop him.

529
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:10,350
The panda? Master,
that panda is not the Dragon Warrior.

530
00:43:10,420 --> 00:43:13,720
He wasn't meant to be here!
It was an accident.

531
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:16,090
There are no accidents.

532
00:43:17,330 --> 00:43:20,450
Yes, I know. You've said that already.

533
00:43:20,530 --> 00:43:24,730
- Twice.
- Well, that was no accident, either.

534
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:25,890
Thrice.

535
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,590
My old friend,

536
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:32,270
the panda will never fulfill
his destiny, nor you yours,

537
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,900
until you let go
of the illusion of control.

538
00:43:35,980 --> 00:43:37,340
Illusion?

539
00:43:37,410 --> 00:43:40,400
Yes. Look at this tree, Shifu.

540
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,510
I cannot make it blossom
when it suits me,

541
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,850
nor make it bear fruit
before its time.

542
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:49,450
But there are things we can control.

543
00:43:50,530 --> 00:43:53,620
I can control when the fruit will fall.

544
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,390
And I can control...

545
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,460
...where to plant the seed.

546
00:43:59,970 --> 00:44:02,060
That is no illusion, Master.

547
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:05,700
Yes.

548
00:44:05,770 --> 00:44:08,170
But no matter what you do

549
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:11,180
that seed will grow to be a peach tree.

550
00:44:11,250 --> 00:44:16,120
You may wish for an apple or an orange,
but you will get a peach.

551
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:19,810
But a peach cannot defeat Tai Lung!

552
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:22,550
Maybe it can.

553
00:44:22,620 --> 00:44:25,420
If you are willing to guide it.

554
00:44:25,490 --> 00:44:27,360
To nurture it.

555
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:28,830
To believe in it.

556
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:31,370
But how? How?

557
00:44:31,430 --> 00:44:33,400
I need your help, Master.

558
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:37,170
No, you just need to believe.

559
00:44:37,870 --> 00:44:40,170
Promise me, Shifu.

560
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:43,470
Promise me you will believe.

561
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:47,110
I will try.

562
00:44:47,950 --> 00:44:49,440
Good.

563
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:53,680
My time has come.

564
00:44:55,890 --> 00:45:00,260
You must continue
your journey without me.

565
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:02,060
What are you? Wait!

566
00:45:04,170 --> 00:45:05,460
Master!

567
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:07,860
You can't leave me!

568
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,270
You must believe.

569
00:45:15,210 --> 00:45:16,800
Master!

570
00:45:47,240 --> 00:45:49,900
Yeah, so I'm like,
"Fine, you may be a wolf,

571
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:52,910
you may be the scariest bandit
in Haijin Province...

572
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,080
...but you're a lousy tipper."

573
00:45:55,150 --> 00:45:58,090
Really? So how did you
get out of there alive?

574
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:01,250
I mean, I didn't actually say that...

575
00:46:01,590 --> 00:46:03,060
...but I thought it...

576
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:04,890
...in my mind.

577
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:08,020
If he could read my mind,
he'd be, like, "What?"

578
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:10,760
Order up! Hope you like it.

579
00:46:12,670 --> 00:46:15,900
- This is really good!
- No, come on.

580
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:20,270
Try my dad's Secret Ingredient Soup.
He actually knows the secret ingredient.

581
00:46:20,340 --> 00:46:22,740
What do you mean? This is amazing!

582
00:46:22,810 --> 00:46:25,750
- You're a really good cook.
- I wish my mouth was bigger.

583
00:46:25,810 --> 00:46:27,710
Tigress, you've got to try this.

584
00:46:27,780 --> 00:46:31,410
It is said that the Dragon Warrior
can survive for months

585
00:46:31,490 --> 00:46:36,290
on nothing but the dew of ginkgo leaf
and the energy of the universe.

586
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:41,560
I guess my body doesn't know
it's the Dragon Warrior yet.

587
00:46:41,630 --> 00:46:46,620
I'm gonna need a lot more
than dew and universe juice.

588
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,130
- What?
- Nothing... Master Shifu.

589
00:46:56,910 --> 00:47:00,940
Never be the Dragon Warrior unless you
lose 500 pounds and brush your teeth!

590
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:05,620
What is that noise you're making?
Laughter? I never heard of it!

591
00:47:05,690 --> 00:47:08,520
Work hard, panda, and maybe someday...

592
00:47:08,590 --> 00:47:10,490
...you will have ears like mine.

593
00:47:12,090 --> 00:47:13,490
That's good.

594
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:17,500
Ears. It's not working for you?
I thought they were pretty good.

595
00:47:17,830 --> 00:47:18,960
It's Shifu!

596
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,870
Of course it's Shifu.
What do you think I'm doing?

597
00:47:23,670 --> 00:47:25,260
Master Shifu!

598
00:47:28,310 --> 00:47:30,000
You think this is funny?

599
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:33,050
Tai Lung has escaped
and you're acting like children!

600
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:35,410
- What?
- He is coming for the Dragon Scroll,

601
00:47:35,480 --> 00:47:37,850
and you are the only one
who can stop him.

602
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,150
And I was saying
you got no sense of humor.

603
00:47:44,230 --> 00:47:46,520
I'm gonna... stop Tai Lung.

604
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:49,430
What? You're serious? And I have to?

605
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,270
Master Oogway will stop him,
like he did before.

606
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:55,860
Oogway cannot!

607
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:57,770
Not anymore.

608
00:47:59,270 --> 00:48:01,970
Our only hope is the Dragon Warrior.

609
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:03,670
- The panda?
- Yes, the panda!

610
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:07,340
Master, let us stop Tai Lung.
This is what you've trained us for.

611
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:10,980
No! It is not your destiny
to defeat Tai Lung.

612
00:48:11,050 --> 00:48:12,640
It is his!

613
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:13,850
Where'd he go?

614
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:24,500
You cannot leave!
A real warrior never quits.

615
00:48:24,570 --> 00:48:26,120
Watch me.

616
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:29,830
Come on.

617
00:48:29,900 --> 00:48:33,740
How am I supposed to beat Tai Lung?
I can't even beat you to the stairs.

618
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:36,800
You will beat him
because you are the Dragon Warrior.

619
00:48:37,610 --> 00:48:40,880
You don't believe that.
You never believed that.

620
00:48:40,950 --> 00:48:43,940
From the beginning,
you've tried to get rid of me.

621
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:46,350
Yes! I was.

622
00:48:46,420 --> 00:48:51,550
But now I ask you to trust in your
master as I have come to trust in mine.

623
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:56,360
You're not my master.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.

624
00:48:56,430 --> 00:49:00,770
Then why didn't you quit?! You knew
I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.

625
00:49:00,870 --> 00:49:02,890
Yeah, I stayed.

626
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:06,700
I stayed because every time
you threw a brick at my head

627
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:11,180
or said I smelled, it hurt,
but it could never hurt more

628
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:14,480
than it did every day
of my life just being me.

629
00:49:15,450 --> 00:49:19,780
I stayed because I thought,
if anyone could change me...

630
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,180
...could make me... not me...

631
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,620
...it was you.

632
00:49:24,860 --> 00:49:27,830
The greatest kung fu teacher
in all of China!

633
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,490
But I can change you!

634
00:49:29,560 --> 00:49:33,090
I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior!
And I will!

635
00:49:33,170 --> 00:49:37,160
Come on. Tai Lung is
on his way here right now.

636
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:40,640
Even if it takes him a hundred years
to get here, how are you...

637
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:44,970
...gonna change this
into the Dragon Warrior?

638
00:49:47,280 --> 00:49:48,270
How?

639
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:50,910
How?

640
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:56,150
- How?!
- I don't know!

641
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:05,760
I don't know.

642
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,570
That's what I thought.

643
00:50:53,210 --> 00:50:55,380
This is what you trained me for.

644
00:51:02,520 --> 00:51:03,510
Tigress!

645
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:09,560
Don't try and stop me.

646
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:13,820
We're not trying to stop you.

647
00:51:13,900 --> 00:51:14,890
What?

648
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,830
We're coming with you!

649
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:33,540
What? I eat when I'm upset, OK?

650
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,150
No need to explain.

651
00:52:36,220 --> 00:52:40,380
I thought you might be Monkey. He hides
his almond cookies on the top shelf.

652
00:53:01,310 --> 00:53:03,000
Don't tell Monkey.

653
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:06,240
- Look at you.
- Yeah, I know, I disgust you.

654
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:09,310
No, I mean, how did you get up there?

655
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:12,150
I don't know. I guess that...

656
00:53:12,490 --> 00:53:14,790
I don't know. I was getting a cookie.

657
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,760
Yet you are ten feet off the ground.

658
00:53:17,790 --> 00:53:20,120
And you have done a perfect spilt.

659
00:53:20,190 --> 00:53:23,160
No, this? This is just...

660
00:53:23,900 --> 00:53:25,230
...an accident.

661
00:53:29,470 --> 00:53:32,530
There are no accidents.

662
00:53:32,610 --> 00:53:33,670
Come with me.

663
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:45,120
I know you're trying to be
all mystical and kung fuey...

664
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:47,920
...but could you at least
tell me where we're going?

665
00:53:57,830 --> 00:54:00,300
You dragged me...

666
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:02,100
...all the way out here...

667
00:54:02,140 --> 00:54:03,470
...for a bath?

668
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:08,440
Panda...

669
00:54:08,510 --> 00:54:12,140
...we do not wash our pits
in the Pool of Sacred Tears.

670
00:54:13,380 --> 00:54:14,410
The Pool of...

671
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:17,080
This is where Oogway
unraveled the mysteries...

672
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,350
...of harmony and focus.

673
00:54:19,420 --> 00:54:21,950
This is the birthplace...

674
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:23,290
...of kung fu.

675
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:39,540
Do you want to learn kung fu?

676
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,600
Yeah!

677
00:54:40,680 --> 00:54:43,940
Then I am your master!

678
00:54:44,010 --> 00:54:45,770
OK!

679
00:54:47,110 --> 00:54:48,210
Don't cry.

680
00:54:48,280 --> 00:54:49,610
OK.

681
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,350
When you focus on kung fu,

682
00:54:57,430 --> 00:54:59,550
when you concentrate...

683
00:54:59,660 --> 00:55:01,130
...you stink.

684
00:55:01,160 --> 00:55:03,060
Perhaps that is my fault.

685
00:55:03,130 --> 00:55:06,590
I cannot train you the way
I have trained the Five.

686
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,760
I now see that the way
to get through to you...

687
00:55:09,840 --> 00:55:11,130
...is with this.

688
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,970
Oh, great, 'cause I am hungry.

689
00:55:14,880 --> 00:55:15,930
Good.

690
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,710
When you have been trained, you may eat.

691
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,310
Let us begin.

692
00:56:32,020 --> 00:56:33,110
After you, panda.

693
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:35,160
Just like that?

694
00:56:35,220 --> 00:56:38,890
No sit-ups? No ten-mile hike?

695
00:56:38,960 --> 00:56:43,450
I vowed to train you, and you
have been trained. You are free to eat.

696
00:56:48,870 --> 00:56:50,460
Enjoy.

697
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:53,470
Hey!

698
00:56:53,540 --> 00:56:56,670
I said you are free to eat.
Have a dumpling.

699
00:56:58,010 --> 00:56:59,480
Hey!

700
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:07,720
You are free to eat.

701
00:57:07,790 --> 00:57:09,690
- Am I?!
- Are you?!

702
00:58:36,080 --> 00:58:37,600
I'm not hungry.

703
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:42,410
Master.

704
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,840
Cut it!

705
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,860
Where's the Dragon Warrior?

706
00:59:32,930 --> 00:59:35,930
How do you know
you're not looking at her?

707
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:38,200
You think I'm a fool?

708
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:41,900
I know you're not the Dragon Warrior.
None of you!

709
00:59:41,980 --> 00:59:45,240
I heard how he fell out
of the sky in a ball of fire.

710
00:59:45,310 --> 00:59:49,750
That he's a warrior unlike
anything the world has ever seen.

711
00:59:49,820 --> 00:59:55,410
- Po?
- So that is his name. Po.

712
00:59:55,490 --> 00:59:58,580
Finally, a worthy opponent.

713
00:59:58,660 --> 01:00:01,150
Our battle will be legendary!

714
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,840
We've got this. Help her.

715
01:00:47,470 --> 01:00:48,460
Monkey!

716
01:00:48,540 --> 01:00:50,370
Go!

717
01:00:50,440 --> 01:00:51,640
What was I thinking?!

718
01:01:02,060 --> 01:01:03,080
Mantis!

719
01:01:08,330 --> 01:01:09,760
Now!

720
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,970
Shifu taught you well.

721
01:02:00,950 --> 01:02:02,880
But he didn't teach you everything.

722
01:02:06,990 --> 01:02:08,480
You have done well, panda.

723
01:02:08,560 --> 01:02:12,250
Done well? Done well?

724
01:02:12,330 --> 01:02:13,620
I've done awesome!

725
01:02:15,330 --> 01:02:18,530
The mark of a true hero is humility.

726
01:02:18,600 --> 01:02:21,300
But, yes, you have done...

727
01:02:21,900 --> 01:02:23,230
...awesome.

728
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,810
Guys? Guys?! They're dead!

729
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,320
No, they're breathing. They're asleep?
But their eyes are open.

730
01:02:37,380 --> 01:02:39,380
We were no match for his nerve attach.

731
01:02:39,450 --> 01:02:41,680
He's gotten stronger.

732
01:02:41,760 --> 01:02:44,050
Who? Tai Lung? Stronger?

733
01:02:45,260 --> 01:02:46,250
He's too fast!

734
01:02:46,330 --> 01:02:47,880
Sorry, Po.

735
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:51,520
I thought we could stop him.

736
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:53,430
He could have killed you.

737
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:54,560
Why didn't he?

738
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:59,040
So you could come back and strike fear
into our hearts. But it won't work.

739
01:02:59,140 --> 01:03:03,440
It might. I mean, a little.

740
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,710
I'm pretty scared.

741
01:03:04,780 --> 01:03:06,270
You can defeat him, panda!

742
01:03:06,350 --> 01:03:09,280
Are you kidding? If they can't?!

743
01:03:09,350 --> 01:03:12,340
They're five masters. I'm just one me.

744
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:15,790
But you will have
the one thing that no one else does.

745
01:03:21,130 --> 01:03:23,620
You really believe I'm ready?

746
01:03:23,700 --> 01:03:25,360
You are...

747
01:03:25,430 --> 01:03:26,730
...Po.

748
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:19,240
Behold the Dragon Scroll.

749
01:04:19,320 --> 01:04:21,250
It is yours.

750
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:24,260
Wait. What happens when I read it?

751
01:04:24,320 --> 01:04:28,350
Legend says you will be able
to hear a butterfly's wing beat.

752
01:04:28,430 --> 01:04:30,660
Really? That's cool.

753
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:33,560
Yes. And see light in the deepest cave.

754
01:04:33,630 --> 01:04:36,540
You will feel the universe
in motion around you.

755
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,640
Can I punch through walls?

756
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:41,070
- Do a quadruple back flip?
- Focus.

757
01:04:41,140 --> 01:04:42,340
- Will I?
- Focus.

758
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,140
- Focus.
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

759
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:47,110
Read it, Po, and fulfill your destiny.

760
01:04:47,180 --> 01:04:49,380
Read it and become...

761
01:04:49,450 --> 01:04:51,180
...the Dragon Warrior.

762
01:04:58,090 --> 01:04:59,520
It's impossible to open.

763
01:05:00,490 --> 01:05:03,730
OK. Come on, baby. Come on now.

764
01:05:05,970 --> 01:05:07,590
Thank you.

765
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:10,070
I probably loosened it up
for you though.

766
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:12,900
OK, here goes.

767
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,580
- It's blank.
- What?!

768
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:30,250
- Here, look.
- No, I am forbidden to look upon...

769
01:05:35,960 --> 01:05:38,830
Blank. I don't...

770
01:05:38,930 --> 01:05:41,090
I don't understand.

771
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,100
OK. So, like...

772
01:05:45,170 --> 01:05:48,400
...Oogway was
just a crazy old turtle after all.

773
01:05:48,480 --> 01:05:51,070
No. Oogway was wiser than us all.

774
01:05:51,140 --> 01:05:55,210
Oh, come on! Face it,
he picked me by accident.

775
01:05:55,280 --> 01:05:59,410
Of course I'm not the Dragon Warrior.
Who am I kidding?

776
01:06:00,450 --> 01:06:02,150
But who will stop Tai Lung?

777
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:04,710
He'll destroy everything and everyone.

778
01:06:04,790 --> 01:06:06,450
No.

779
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:12,290
Evacuate the valley. You must protect
the villagers from Tai Lung's rage.

780
01:06:12,370 --> 01:06:14,770
- What about you, Master?
- I will fight him.

781
01:06:14,840 --> 01:06:17,530
- What?
- I can hold him off long enough

782
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:19,070
for everyone to escape.

783
01:06:19,140 --> 01:06:21,570
But, Shifu, he'll kill you.

784
01:06:21,640 --> 01:06:24,480
Then I will finally have paid
for my mistake.

785
01:06:25,450 --> 01:06:27,540
Listen to me, all of you.

786
01:06:27,610 --> 01:06:31,140
It is time for you to continue
your journey without me.

787
01:06:31,220 --> 01:06:34,210
I am very proud
to have been your master.

788
01:06:55,010 --> 01:06:57,370
We've got to get them out safely.

789
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:59,780
Come, little one. Let's find your mama.

790
01:06:59,880 --> 01:07:03,370
Viper, gather the southern farmers.
Mantis, the north.

791
01:07:03,420 --> 01:07:05,180
Crane, light the way.

792
01:07:24,240 --> 01:07:27,260
Look, it's the Dragon Warrior.

793
01:07:35,980 --> 01:07:37,380
Hey, Dad.

794
01:07:37,980 --> 01:07:39,280
Po!

795
01:07:45,190 --> 01:07:47,290
Good to have you back, son.

796
01:07:49,760 --> 01:07:51,250
Good to be back.

797
01:07:51,330 --> 01:07:52,960
Let's go, Po.

798
01:07:55,470 --> 01:07:58,300
So for our next shop,
it's time to face it...

799
01:07:58,570 --> 01:08:02,060
...the future of noodles
is dice-cut vegetables...

800
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:04,500
...no longer slices.

801
01:08:04,580 --> 01:08:08,010
Also, I was thinking, maybe this time

802
01:08:08,080 --> 01:08:11,240
we'll have a kitchen
you can actually stand up in.

803
01:08:12,550 --> 01:08:13,750
You like that?

804
01:08:19,890 --> 01:08:24,490
Po, I'm sorry if things didn't work out.

805
01:08:24,560 --> 01:08:27,590
It just wasn't meant to be.

806
01:08:31,070 --> 01:08:33,560
Po, forget everything else.

807
01:08:33,640 --> 01:08:35,840
Your destiny still awaits.

808
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:40,680
We are noodle folk.
Broth runs deep through our veins.

809
01:08:40,780 --> 01:08:43,050
I don't know, Dad.

810
01:08:43,120 --> 01:08:47,110
Honestly, sometimes
I can't believe I'm actually your son.

811
01:08:50,490 --> 01:08:51,580
Po...

812
01:08:51,660 --> 01:08:56,100
...I think it's time I told you
something I should have told you...

813
01:08:56,160 --> 01:08:58,220
...a long time ago.

814
01:08:58,300 --> 01:09:00,030
OK.

815
01:09:01,400 --> 01:09:05,530
The secret ingredient
of my Secret Ingredient Soup.

816
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:12,910
Come here. The secret ingredient is...

817
01:09:12,980 --> 01:09:13,970
...nothing.

818
01:09:15,450 --> 01:09:17,880
You heard me. Nothing!

819
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:20,420
There is no secret ingredient!

820
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,550
Wait, wait.
It's just plain old noodle soup?

821
01:09:23,620 --> 01:09:26,490
You don't add some kind of special
sauce or something?

822
01:09:26,560 --> 01:09:30,960
Don't have to. To make something
special, you just believe it's special.

823
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:44,130
There is no secret ingredient.

824
01:10:06,730 --> 01:10:09,530
I have come home, Master.

825
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:12,870
This is no longer your home.
And I am no longer your master.

826
01:10:12,940 --> 01:10:16,880
Oh, yes. You have a new favorite.

827
01:10:16,940 --> 01:10:20,040
So where is this Po?

828
01:10:21,480 --> 01:10:22,710
Did I scare him off?

829
01:10:22,780 --> 01:10:25,110
This battle is between you and me.

830
01:10:26,520 --> 01:10:29,960
So, that is how it's going to be.

831
01:10:30,020 --> 01:10:32,050
That is how it must be.

832
01:10:46,210 --> 01:10:50,770
I rotted in jail for 20 years
because of your weakness!

833
01:10:50,840 --> 01:10:53,210
Obeying your master is not weakness!

834
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,080
You knew I was the Dragon Warrior.

835
01:10:56,150 --> 01:10:58,310
You always knew.

836
01:10:58,390 --> 01:11:03,320
But when Oogway said otherwise,
what did you do?

837
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:06,980
What did you do?!

838
01:11:09,530 --> 01:11:10,660
Nothing!

839
01:11:10,730 --> 01:11:13,560
You were not meant to be the Dragon
Warrior! That was not my fault!

840
01:11:13,630 --> 01:11:15,600
Not your fault?!

841
01:11:15,670 --> 01:11:17,730
Who filled my head with dreams?!

842
01:11:17,800 --> 01:11:20,030
Who drove me to train
until my bones cracked?!

843
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:22,840
Who denied me my destiny?!

844
01:11:32,090 --> 01:11:34,680
It was never my decision to make!

845
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,460
It is now.

846
01:11:46,530 --> 01:11:50,300
Give me the scroll!

847
01:11:50,370 --> 01:11:51,600
I would rather die.

848
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:44,850
All I ever did, I did to make you proud!

849
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:47,520
Tell me how proud you are, Shifu!

850
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,990
Tell me!

851
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,260
Tell me!

852
01:13:02,580 --> 01:13:05,940
I have...
I have always been proud of you.

853
01:13:07,080 --> 01:13:10,410
From the first moment, I've been...

854
01:13:10,480 --> 01:13:12,780
...proud of you.

855
01:13:12,850 --> 01:13:15,220
And it was my pride...

856
01:13:15,290 --> 01:13:17,310
...that blinded me.

857
01:13:17,390 --> 01:13:20,950
I loved you too much
to see what you were becoming...

858
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:24,230
...what I...

859
01:13:24,300 --> 01:13:26,290
...was turning you into.

860
01:13:27,100 --> 01:13:29,070
I'm...

861
01:13:29,140 --> 01:13:30,120
I'm sorry.

862
01:13:38,650 --> 01:13:41,380
I don't want your apology.

863
01:13:41,450 --> 01:13:42,970
I want my scroll!

864
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:47,420
What?!

865
01:13:47,490 --> 01:13:48,720
Where is it?!

866
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:54,320
Dragon Warrior has taken the scroll
halfway across China by now.

867
01:13:55,460 --> 01:13:58,590
You will never see
that scroll, Tai Lung.

868
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:00,000
Never.

869
01:14:00,930 --> 01:14:01,920
Never.

870
01:14:08,880 --> 01:14:10,170
Stairs.

871
01:14:12,610 --> 01:14:14,410
Who are you?

872
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:19,510
Buddy, I am the Dragon Warrior.

873
01:14:22,520 --> 01:14:23,850
You?

874
01:14:24,820 --> 01:14:26,790
Him? He's a panda.

875
01:14:26,860 --> 01:14:30,730
You're a panda. What are
you gonna do, big guy? Sit on me?

876
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,730
Don't tempt me.

877
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:36,830
No. I'm gonna use this.

878
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:38,530
You want it? Come and get it.

879
01:14:40,270 --> 01:14:41,570
Finally!

880
01:15:07,530 --> 01:15:09,000
That scroll is mine!

881
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:03,780
Lightning!

882
01:16:38,990 --> 01:16:40,980
The scroll has given him power!

883
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,190
No!

884
01:17:19,670 --> 01:17:23,600
Finally! Oh, yes.

885
01:17:23,670 --> 01:17:28,540
The power of the Dragon Scroll is mine!

886
01:17:32,850 --> 01:17:34,870
It's nothing!

887
01:17:36,850 --> 01:17:39,440
It's OK. I didn't get it
the first time, either.

888
01:17:40,220 --> 01:17:41,240
What?

889
01:17:42,490 --> 01:17:44,290
There is no secret ingredient.

890
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:49,060
It's just you.

891
01:17:58,840 --> 01:17:59,900
Stop it!

892
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:01,740
I'm gonna pee.

893
01:18:03,310 --> 01:18:04,940
Don't.

894
01:18:05,010 --> 01:18:06,670
Don't! Don't!

895
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:15,740
You...

896
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:18,050
...can't defeat me.

897
01:19:22,490 --> 01:19:23,720
You...

898
01:19:25,060 --> 01:19:26,860
...you're just a big...

899
01:19:26,930 --> 01:19:28,520
...fat...

900
01:19:28,590 --> 01:19:29,580
...panda!

901
01:19:30,560 --> 01:19:33,690
I'm not a big fat panda.

902
01:19:33,770 --> 01:19:36,060
I'm the big fat panda.

903
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,770
The Wuxi Finger Hold!

904
01:19:39,840 --> 01:19:41,270
Oh, you know this hold?

905
01:19:41,340 --> 01:19:45,300
You're bluffing. You're bluffing.
Shifu didn't teach you that.

906
01:19:45,380 --> 01:19:47,070
Nope.

907
01:19:47,150 --> 01:19:49,340
I figured it out. Skadoosh.

908
01:20:09,870 --> 01:20:11,100
Look!

909
01:20:12,140 --> 01:20:14,230
The Dragon Warrior.

910
01:20:41,700 --> 01:20:46,570
That's my boy! That big lovely
kung fu warrior is my son!

911
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:49,730
Yes!

912
01:20:51,010 --> 01:20:52,570
Thanks, Dad.

913
01:21:01,850 --> 01:21:03,250
Hey, guys.

914
01:21:07,990 --> 01:21:09,330
Master.

915
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:10,830
Master.

916
01:21:13,730 --> 01:21:15,500
Master?

917
01:21:15,570 --> 01:21:17,040
Master Shifu!

918
01:21:30,080 --> 01:21:31,450
Master!

919
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:33,610
Shifu, are you OK?!

920
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:37,390
Po.

921
01:21:37,460 --> 01:21:39,390
You're alive.

922
01:21:39,460 --> 01:21:40,690
Or we're both dead.

923
01:21:40,760 --> 01:21:44,700
No, Master, I didn't die.
I defeated Tai Lung.

924
01:21:44,760 --> 01:21:45,890
You did?

925
01:21:50,170 --> 01:21:55,900
Wow. It is as Oogway foretold.

926
01:21:55,980 --> 01:21:59,470
You are the Dragon Warrior.

927
01:22:00,210 --> 01:22:02,680
You have brought peace...

928
01:22:02,750 --> 01:22:05,510
...to this valley...

929
01:22:05,590 --> 01:22:07,780
...and...

930
01:22:07,850 --> 01:22:09,480
...and to me.

931
01:22:09,560 --> 01:22:10,820
Thank you.

932
01:22:12,660 --> 01:22:15,890
Thank you, Po.

933
01:22:15,960 --> 01:22:18,560
Thank you. Thank you.

934
01:22:24,070 --> 01:22:29,060
No! Master! No, no, no,
don't die, Shifu, please!

935
01:22:29,140 --> 01:22:31,870
I'm not dying, you idiot!

936
01:22:31,940 --> 01:22:33,910
Dragon Warrior...

937
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:40,020
...I am simply at peace. Finally.

938
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,690
So, I should stop talking?

939
01:22:46,390 --> 01:22:48,020
If you can.

940
01:23:06,110 --> 01:23:07,700
Want to get something to eat?

941
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:11,480
Yeah.
